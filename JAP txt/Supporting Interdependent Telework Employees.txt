Work Withdrawal

The COVID-19 crisis has compelled many organizations to implement full-time telework for their employees
in a bid to prevent a transmission of the virus. At the same time, the volatile COVID-19 situation presents
unique, unforeseen daily disruptive task setbacks that divert employees’ attention from routinized work tasks
and require them to respond adaptively and effortfully. Yet, little is known about how telework employees
react to such complex demands and regulate their work behaviors while working from home. Drawing on
Hobfoll’s (1989) conservation of resources (COR) theory, we develop a multilevel, two-stage moderatedmediation model arguing that daily COVID-19 task setbacks are stressors that would trigger a resource loss
process and will thus be positively related to the employee’s end-of-day emotional exhaustion. The emotionally exhausted employee then enters a resource preservation mode that precipitates a positive relationship
between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behaviors. Based on COR, we also predict that
the relation between daily COVID-19 task setbacks and exhaustion would be more positive in telework
employees who have higher (vs. lower) task interdependence with coworkers, but organizations could
alleviate the positive relation between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behavior by
providing employees with higher (vs. lower) telework task support. We collected daily experience-sampling
data over 10 workdays from 120 employees (Level 1, n ⫽ 1,022) who were teleworking full-time due to the
pandemic lockdown. The results generally supported our hypotheses, and their implications for scholars and
managers during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

essary for performing their job and interact face-to-face with
coworkers to coordinate work tasks (Gajendran & Harrison, 2007).
Past research has associated this type of voluntary, partial telework
with reduced stress and withdrawal, as well as better performance,
and they attributed these benefits to the greater autonomy and
schedule flexibility that telework extends to employees (Allen,
Golden, & Shockley, 2015; Gajendran & Harrison, 2007).
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that swept
rapidly across the globe in early 2020 conferred a new meaning to
telework. As this acute respiratory disease transmits through physical contact (World Health Organization, 2020), many organizations have since discouraged or forbidden nonessential employees
from physically reporting to work in order to observe social
distancing for halting the virus spread (Guyot & Sawhill, 2020).
This pushed the incidence of telework to an unprecedented tipping
point. In the United States, 65% of the workforce were teleworking
full-time in early May 2020 (Gallup, 2020), a multifold increase
from the 11% who had access to partial telework pre-COVID-19
(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). All other regions, including Europe (Lomas, 2020) and Asia (Liang, 2020; Tay, 2020), saw
record telework rates in the period too. We argue that this form of
mandatory telework is fundamentally distinct from the aforementioned partial telework offered as a flexible work arrangement.

Many organizations have long offered telework, also known as
telecommuting, remote work, or working from home, as a form of
flexible work arrangement to enable employees to better manage
increasing demands from their work and family (Shockley &
Allen, 2010). Under a typical telework arrangement, an employee
splits their work time between working at the office and working
from home or a preferred off-site location. When physically at the
office, the employee can access organizational infrastructure nec-

DAILY COVID-19 TASK SETBACKS AND WORK WITHDRAWAL

This is because employees now have little or no volition to decide
whether and when to telework, and their ability to access to
physical infrastructure, tools, and resources in their workplaces is
also severely restricted under this work arrangement.
To complicate matters, the COVID-19 crisis has far-reaching
impacts on diverse occupations, because effective responses to
COVID-19 require joint and collective efforts across nations,
governments, industries, and communities. The evolving and volatile nature of both the COVID-19 situation and the adaptive
countermeasures creates new and unfamiliar problems that disrupt
the original job scopes of many telework employees working in
diverse fields. For examples, public sector employees have to now
deal with pressing issues such as health care provision, abrupt and
rapidly rising unemployment, and trade disruptions due to restrained international mobility (Evans, 2020). Educators have to
conduct classes virtually (Lim-Lange, 2020). Hospitality staff need
to devise creative ways to maintain revenue while observing social
distancing guidelines and travel bans (Djeebet, 2020).
Integrating past research on organizational constraints (Pindek
& Spector, 2016) and goal disruption (Zohar, 1999) into the
current situation, we define the abovementioned task-related disruptions and inhibitions arising from the COVID-19 situation as
C19 task setbacks. They encompass constraints or disruptive
events broadly related to the COVID-19 situation, such as but not
limited to lockdown regulations, social-distancing rules, trade or
travel disruptions, COVID-19’s impact on business operations,
preparation for business reopening after the lockdown, or any
issues that originated from the COVID-19 situation and did not
exist prior to the pandemic. These C19 task setbacks are distinct
from conventional organizational constraints like faulty equipment
or poor communication that are directly embedded in employees’
immediate work situation (Pindek & Spector, 2016) because they
are linked to the dynamic macroenvironment beyond employees’
organization. The unpredictability C19 task setbacks interfere with
employees’ focus, divert their attention from their typical day-today job scope, and require effortful responses. We therefore contend that these unforeseen, unique C19 task setbacks could have
undesirable effects on the daily psychological and behavioral
outcomes of telework employees.
Drawing on Hobfoll’s (1989) conservation of resources (COR)
theory, we develop a multilevel, moderated-mediation model to
argue that daily C19 task setbacks are positively related to endof-day emotional exhaustion and subsequently next-day work
withdrawal behaviors in telework employees. We also predict that
the link between daily C19 task setbacks and exhaustion would be
more positive in telework employees with higher (vs. lower) task
interdependence with their coworkers, but organizations can alleviate the relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day
work withdrawal by providing employees with higher (vs. lower)
telework task support.
Our research aims to make several contributions. First, we take
a theoretically driven approach to generate timely knowledge for
understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic affects employees.
Being a deadly pandemic, COVID-19 is an “exogenous sanitary
shock” to the economy (Strauss-Kahn, 2020). It is accompanied by
an onslaught of economic, societal, and mortality concerns that are
matchless by both past financial crises (Tooze, 2020) and former
day-to-day task disruptions or organizational constraints that employees were used to (Newton, 2020). Our examination of how

1409

daily C19 task setbacks are linked to employees’ daily exhaustion
and withdrawal behaviors is therefore critical to assess the extent
of damage generated by the pandemic and the readiness of employees and organizations to tackle it.
Second, the COVID-19 pandemic unearths an unstudied domain
within the telework literature. Many organizations had little choice
but to hastily transition to mandatory, full-time telework to counter
the spread of COVID-19. This mandatory form of full-time telework is unlike the erstwhile flexible, partial telework that existing
research had studied and that employees were used to. In fact, the
COVID-19 situation has removed a large degree of flexibility or
volition that telework used to offer workers. It is thus essential to
investigate how this current form of telework holds up during the
pandemic and for whom it is more or less suitable. By examining
task interdependence as our hypothesized first-stage moderator, we
take a step in identifying a group of employees who may find it
more difficult working at decentralized locations as their coworkers during a trying period like this.
Finally, examining organizational task support for telework as a
second-stage moderator identifies a contextual factor that may
mitigate the negative effect of C19 task setbacks. This offers
insights into how organizations can assuage the toll that daily C19
task setbacks take on their employees who are now compelled to
work from home.

COR Theory and Model Development
The COR theory offers a framework for understanding employee stress from the perspective of why and how employees lose
resources, protect existing resources, and gain new resources
(Hobfoll, 1989). Resources in this context refer to “anything
perceived by the individual to help attain his or her goals” (p. 5)
and can include energies and emotions (Halbesleben, Neveu,
Paustian-Underdahl, & Westman, 2014). Fluctuation of resources
is one of the theory’s key elements, and Halbesleben et al. (2014)
recommended researchers to adopt an episodic, experiencesampling approach to examine resource trajectories within the
limits of a timeframe when testing COR. We regard the episodic
approach highly suitable for this research because COVID-19 is an
ongoing pandemic that unfolds bit by bit, and organizations revise
their advisories and practices by the day to deal with the frequent
turns of events (Ellis, 2020; Lyons, 2020). Telework employees
may therefore receive new and sometimes contradictory work
instructions on different days that disrupt how they originally
perform their work duties (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2020). These task-related disruptions and complications brought specifically about by the pandemic are daily C19
task setbacks. Considering Halbesleben et al.’s (2014) advice
alongside the volatile nature of the pandemic, we focus on examining the within-person relationships between daily C19 task setbacks and next-day work withdrawal behavior via end-of-day
exhaustion.
Halbesleben et al. (2014) also highlighted the importance of
context in understanding within-person resource fluctuations based
on the COR theory. They explained that the context, such as job
nature, organizational climate, and organizational support, acts as
boundaries that potentially signal to an individual how resourcedraining a trigger is or how valuable resources are. Incorporating
this premise into our model, we identify task interdependence as a

1410

first-stage moderator that exacerbates the relation of daily C19 task
setbacks with end-of-day exhaustion and organizational telework
task support as a second-stage moderator that alleviates the relation of end-of-day exhaustion with next-day work withdrawal in
telework employees. Our model is summarized in Figure 1.

Daily C19 Task Setbacks and End-of-Day
Emotional Exhaustion
The COR theory argues that a resource loss can be caused by a
“shock to one’s cognitive processing that forces the individual to
carefully evaluate this new information” (Halbesleben et al., 2014,
p. 18). The COVID-19 crisis has generated additional and unpredictable work demands for many occupations in different industries. Policy and operational changes enacted jointly by public and
private agencies to counter the pandemic permeate from the ecological environment into the organizational environment. We regard these daily C19 task setbacks as work-related stressors that
function in a similar manner as organizational constraints (Pindek
& Spector, 2016) and goal-disruptive events (Zohar, 1999) to
trigger a resource loss process characterized by end-of-day emotional exhaustion.
These C19 task setbacks require employees to appraise unforeseen problems, unlearn their existing automatic task scripts
promptly, develop novel solutions, learn new ways of operations,
and adapt to updated rules and advisories, all of which are complex
cognitive activities that deplete resources rapidly (Muraven &
Baumeister, 2000; Schmeichel, Vohs, & Baumeister, 2003). C19
task setbacks also reinforce the salience of this pandemic’s threats,
which may evoke stress and worry about mortality and job security
(Tan, 2020). Hence, employees must exert regulatory resources to
manage negative thoughts and emotions to continue focusing on
their tasks, which further drain their resources (Johns, Inzlicht, &
Schmader, 2008). We therefore argue that daily C19 task setbacks
can rapidly drain the resources of telework employees and reduce
them to emotional exhaustion by the end of the day (Maslach &
Jackson, 1981).
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Daily C19 task setbacks are positively
related to end-of-day emotional exhaustion.

Task Interdependence as First-Stage Moderator
The COR theory asserts the importance of considering the
extraindividual context that can serve as a “fertile or infertile
ground” (p. 107) to steep the within-person resource fluctuation
process (Hobfoll, Halbesleben, Neveu, & Westman, 2018). We
contend that telework employees who have higher (vs. lower) task
interdependence with their coworkers will experience greater endof-day exhaustion from daily C19 task setbacks. Employees with
higher task interdependence rely on and interact frequently with
their coworkers to coordinate efforts toward achieving common
work goals (Morgeson & Humphrey, 2006). They have shared
habitual mental models of how to perform work tasks interdependently (Burke, Stagl, Salas, Pierce, & Kendall, 2006). Therefore,
when daily C19 task setbacks hit employees with higher task
interdependence, the setbacks will likely implicate an entire cluster
of interdependent employees. This deviation from shared work
routines brought about by daily C19 task setbacks will require not
only a teleworker’s direct investment of resources into appraising
the situation and developing action plans but also resources into
communicating, coordinating, and synchronizing efforts with coworkers in order to resolve the issues at hand collectively (Shepperd, 1993) while working at different locations. As highlighted by
Burke et al. (2006), team-level situational assessment, plan formulation, execution, and learning consume a considerable amount of
individual and shared resources. Considering employees’ unfamiliarity with the COVID-19 crisis, it is more likely for interdependent employees to have to expend greater resources into tackling
daily C19 task setbacks, thus draining their resources more rapidly
and leading to greater exhaustion by the end of the day.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): The relationship between daily C19 task
setbacks and end-of-day exhaustion is more positive in telework employees who have higher (vs. lower) task interdependence with their coworkers.

End-of-Day Emotional Exhaustion and Next-Day
Work Withdrawal Behavior
One of the COR principles states that when people exhaust their
resources, they focus on preserving themselves from a further loss

DAILY COVID-19 TASK SETBACKS AND WORK WITHDRAWAL

of resources (Hobfoll et al., 2018). This suggests a positive relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behavior. Withdrawal is a counterproductive work behavior
that characterizes an employee’s bid to avoid their work in order to
escape from job stressors (Spector et al., 2006). It entails restricting the amount of time and effort spent on work, such as absence,
late arrival or early departure, and taking undeserved breaks (Spector et al., 2006). As telework employees are not constantly visible
to their supervisor and coworkers, there is comparatively less
deterrence for them to engage in work withdrawal behavior. Telework employees can usually decide their preferred time to begin or
end work with less immediate social sanction from coworkers, and
they can engage in personal activities during their work hours.
Under these telework conditions, we expect the experience of
exhaustion from C19 task setbacks the previous day to activate the
resource preservation mode and prompt work withdrawal the next
day in telework employees. Doing so offers them a temporary
respite from C19 task setbacks for preventing further loss of
resource (Chong, Kim, Lee, Johnson, & Lin, 2020; Kiazad, Seibert, & Kraimer, 2014). Relatedly, past research showed that withdrawal is an emotion-based coping strategy for exhausted employees who have little control over their job stressors (Krischer,
Penney, & Hunter, 2010). This is analogous to the lack of control
that employees have over the COVID-19 situation. Finally, withdrawal from work also buys employees time for their resource pool
to replenish (Trougakos & Hideg, 2009). Thus, we hypothesize the
following:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): End-of-day emotional exhaustion is positively related to next-day work withdrawal behavior.

Organizational Telework Task Support as SecondStage Moderator
For the final part of our model, we refer back to the COR for
potential ways to mitigate the above hypothesized dysfunctional selfpreservation behavior (withdrawal) in response to depleted resources
(exhaustion). The COR emphasizes that “ecological conditions [such
as social and environmental conditions can] foster and nurture or limit
and block resource creation and sustenance” (p. 107) after individuals
experience resource loss (Hobfoll et al., 2018). The COVID-19 crisis
compelled the majority of employees to switch to full-time telework
relatively abruptly without much option to prepare for this work
arrangement (Agade, 2020; Liang, 2020; Lomas, 2020). Thus, we
propose the importance of organizational telework task support as an
environmental factor that expands employees’ capacity and resource
pool for mitigating the relationship between end-of-day exhaustion
and next-day withdrawal behavior. Adapting the definition of perceived organizational support (Eisenberger, Stinglhamber, Vandenberghe, Sucharski, & Rhoades, 2002), we define organizational telework task support as employees’ belief in how much the organization
is making an effort to provide them with necessary telework-related
resources while they are working from home, such as information
technology (IT) support, timely information, relevant work materials,
and decision-making authority.
Social cues presented by an organization can shape employees’
responses toward resource loss (Halbesleben et al., 2014). Based on
the crossover mechanism in COR, when employees perceive their
organizations’ efforts to help them work well from home, they will

1411

recognize that they can draw from this organizational support (i.e., an
external resource pool) to replenish their own resources after experiencing exhaustion from C19 task setbacks the previous day. The
telework task support offered by the organization also serves to
enhance employees’ perceived control over their environment,
thereby regenerating their coping efficacy (Richardson, Yang, Vandenberg, DeJoy, & Wilson, 2008). On the other hand, if an organization is indifferent about offering telework task support, it may
further convince exhausted employees that they are isolated and
unable to rely on organizational resources to replenish their own
resources in their endeavor to overcome the job stressors (Richardson
et al., 2008). This crippling feeling will likely strengthen the positive
relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day withdrawal
behavior.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): The relationship between end-of-day emotional exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behavior is
more positive in employees who perceive lower (vs. higher)
organizational support for telework.
We integrate the prior hypotheses into a two-stage moderated
mediation model to address why daily C19 task setbacks are related to
next-day work withdrawal behavior (i.e., via end-of-day exhaustion),
for whom the relationship will be more readily observed (i.e., for
telework employees who have higher task interdependence with coworkers), and finally how to mitigate this relationship (i.e., by providing higher organizational telework task support). This specific
positioning of task interdependence as a first-stage moderator and
organizational telework task support as a second-stage moderator is
based on two key principles of COR. First, the resource loss process
possesses greater momentum than that of preventing resource loss
(Hobfoll et al., 2018). This suggests that in the face of an external
shock (i.e., daily C19 task setbacks), the moderating effect of a factor
that exacerbates resource loss (i.e., higher task interdependence) will
be more salient and observable than the moderating effect of a factor
that prevents resource loss (i.e., higher organizational telework task
support). Thus, we expect task interdependence to function as a
first-stage moderator.
Second, the COR theory (Hobfoll et al., 2018) asserts that individuals will actively seek to prevent further loss and to regain resources
by drawing from internal or external resource pools typically after
they have experienced the loss (i.e., emotional exhaustion in our case).
This means that individuals experiencing emotional exhaustion will
try turning their attention away from stressors that deplete them (i.e.,
daily C19 task setbacks and task interdependence) and direct their
focus on potential means of redress (i.e., organizational telework task
support) in order to set their resource reclamation process in motion.
Some past research offers preliminary evidence for our arguments.
They demonstrated resource pool or capacity (i.e., job control or trait
emotional control) as a significant second-stage moderator mitigating
the relations between resource loss (e.g., depletion or negative emotions) and work behavioral outcomes (Lanaj, Johnson, & Barnes,
2014; Tong, Chong, & Johnson, 2019), instead of a first-stage moderator buffering the effects of stressors on resource loss.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): The indirect positive relationship between
daily C19 task setbacks and next-day work withdrawal behaviors via end-of-day emotional exhaustion is the most positive
in employees with higher (vs. lower) task interdependence and
lower (vs. higher) organizational telework support.

Contextual Background, Procedure, and Participants
The data for this article were part of a broader data collection effort.
The procedure was reviewed and approved by the Nanyang Technological University Institutional Review Board (IRB-2019 – 090-037–
01; Title: Work Experience of Individuals). We collected the data in
Singapore during its 8-week nationwide lockdown that began on
April 7, 2020, during which it was mandatory for all employees to
telework where possible. This resulted in 85% of the workforce
working from home (Tay, 2020). Only individuals employed in essential services such as health care, cleaning, and food preparation
were permitted to report physically to their workplaces. The surveys
were administered between the fifth and seventh weeks of the lockdown. By this time, employees would have acclimatized to the telework arrangement, thus allowing us to avoid any initial honeymoonhangover effect (Boswell, Boudreau, & Tichy, 2005) associated with
the novelty of mandatory telework.
Participants were recruited via snowball sampling. The first
author posted a recruitment advertisement on her social media
profile and disseminated the advertisement directly to 20 personal
and professional contacts working in diverse occupations for
snowball sharing. The advertisement indicated that this was a
research on work attitudes and behaviors without disclosing the
exact research topic. It stated that participants would receive S$65
for completing a baseline survey and 10 daily surveys. Interested
individuals accessed a survey link to answer eligibility questions,
which included age (at least 18 years old), residence (Singapore),
and employment status (employed and teleworking full-time). Out
of the 228 individuals who responded to the eligibility survey

within 2 days, 204 met all eligibility criteria and were invited to
complete the baseline survey, and 128 completed the baseline
survey by the stipulated deadline. In the following week, we
emailed and texted a survey link to participants at 8 p.m. for 10
workdays. They had to complete the survey before 3 a.m. the next
day. Participants submitted the survey at 9:05 p.m. on average. Out
of the participants who completed the baseline survey, 127 completed at least one daily survey, and we received 1,197 daily
responses in total (response rate of 93.5%). As the outcome variable was work withdrawal behavior on the next workday (i.e., a
lagged variable), participants who completed only one daily survey
(n ⫽ 7) were dropped. The predictor and mediator data collected
on days that had missing consecutive next-day responses due to
participants skipping a survey (n ⫽ 48) and on Day 10 (i.e., there
was no Day 11 withdrawal behavior data after the final Day 10
survey; n ⫽ 120) were also excluded. This resulted in a final
sample of 1,022 daily responses (Level 1 n) from 120 participants
(Level 2 n).
Participants were 65.8% females and 97.5% ethnic Chinese, and
they had a mean age of 32.3 (SD ⫽ 5.0). On average, their
organizational tenure was 4.4 years (SD ⫽ 4.1) and weekly work
hours were 40.6 (SD ⫽ 16.3). They came from diverse industries,
for example, civil service (20.0%), specialized fields of law or
research (15.8%), financial sector (15.0%), and education (7.5%).

Control variables. We controlled for prior day sleep quality
(i.e., “How well did you sleep last night?” 1 ⫽ very poorly; 5 ⫽
very well) when predicting end-of-day exhaustion as sleep quality
affects exhaustion (Söderström, Jeding, Ekstedt, Perski, & Åkerstedt, 2012). We also controlled for current-day work withdrawal
behavior when predicting next-day work withdrawal behavior to
account for autoregression. Finally, we controlled for Friday (1 ⫽
Friday; 0 ⫽ other days) when predicting exhaustion and withdrawal behavior to account for any “Thank-God-it’s-Friday” effects (Stone, Schneider, & Harter, 2012).

Results
Table 2 presents the correlations of the variables, and Table 3
presents the variances and intraclass correlation ICC(1) values.
Within-person variances ranged from 33.13% to 54.55%, justifying
the use of experience sampling. We conducted a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis to assess the measurement model. Daily C19
task setbacks, exhaustion, and work withdrawal were estimated on
both the within-person and between-person levels, and general task
interdependence and organizational telework support were estimated
on the between-person level.1 The factor structure had fit indices of
␹2(131) ⫽ 225.489, comparative fix index (CFI) ⫽ .98, root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) ⫽ .03, standardized root
mean square residual (SRMR)Within ⫽ .02, and SRMRBetween ⫽ .09.
All alternative models, in which items from two factors were loaded
onto a single factor, had a poorer fit to the data (218.96 ⱕ ⌬␹2(4 ⬍
⌬df ⬍ 6) ⱕ 1,171.94, p ⬍ .01), thus supporting our five focal
variables as distinct.
To test our hypotheses, we ran a multilevel moderatedmediation model in MPlus v8 (Muthén & Muthén, 2012) using
observed variables. The use of observed over latent variables was
guided by precedence (Lanaj et al., 2014; Uy, Lin, & Ilies, 2017)

and more importantly informed by scholars who have raised concerns about the interpretability of estimating cross-level interactions using latent variables (Hayes, Montoya, & Rockwood, 2017;
Maslowsky, Jager, & Hemken, 2015). We created a lagged variable to match next-workday withdrawal behavior to current-day
C19 task setback (predictor) and exhaustion (mediator) for analyses. Exogenous between-person variables were grand-meancentered and exogenous within-person variables were groupmean-centered (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Culpepper, 2013). To
examine slope variability (Bliese, 2016; Snijders & Bosker, 2012),
we compared the ⫺2 loglikelihood of a model with and a model
without random slopes between daily C19 task setbacks, end-ofday exhaustion, and next-day withdrawal (refer to Table 4). The
difference of 67.78 indicated significant between-person slope
variability, p ⫽ .00, and justified the use random slopes for the a
path (i.e., predictor-mediator) and b path (i.e., mediator-outcome).
Paths involving control variables were modeled as fixed slopes
(Wang, Liao, Zhan, & Shi, 2011).
The results from the full hypothesized moderated-mediation
model are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 5 (Model 4). Daily
C19 task setbacks were positively related to end-of-day exhaustion
(␥ ⫽ .18, SE ⫽ 06, p ⫽ .00), thus supporting H1. This relationship
was significantly moderated by task interdependence (␥ ⫽ .17,
1
Following guidelines from past scale development research for detecting common error variance (Avolio, Bass, & Jung, 1999; Miller, Jenkins,
Kaplan, & Salonen, 1995), we allowed two items of the withdrawal
scale—“I took a longer break from work than allowed today” and “I
worked less hours than formally allowed today”—with a high modification
index (⬎200) to covary within the factor, without any change to the factor
structure. Before covarying them, the fit indices of the factor structure
were ␹2(133) ⫽ 628.19, CFI ⫽ .90, RMSEA ⫽ .06, SRMRWithin ⫽ .08,

Note. Level 1, n ⫽ 1,022; Level 2, n ⫽ 120. ICC(1) values represent the proportion of variance that can be

SE ⫽ .07, p ⫽ .02), such that it was more positive for employees
who had higher (vs. lower) task interdependence with their coworkers, thus supporting H2. Figure 2 illustrates the simple slopes
(Preacher, Curran, & Bauer, 2006). End-of-day exhaustion was not
significantly related to next-workday withdrawal behavior (␥ ⫽
.02, SE ⫽ .02, p ⫽ .33), thus not supporting H3. Nevertheless, the
second-stage moderation was significant and supported H4
(␥ ⫽ ⫺.05, SE ⫽ .02, p ⫽ .03). The simple slopes (see Figure 3)
showed that the relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and
next-day withdrawal behavior was positive and significant for
employees who perceived lower organizational telework task support, and it was not significant for employees who perceived
higher organizational task support for telework. To evaluate effect
sizes, we calculated R2 values. There are several R2 approaches for
multilevel research. Lang, Bliese, and Runge (2019) recommended
using a generalized R2 statistic for estimating simple multilevel
models, while Rights and Sterba (2019a, 2019b) encouraged the
decomposition of R2 values into their respective levels for complex
models. Given that our model is relatively complex with a twostage, cross-level moderated mediation, we reported the multilevel

R2 values suggested by Rights and Sterba (2019a, 2019b) to
understand how our predictors at the two levels contribute to the
explained variances of dependent variables (see Table 6).
We calculated conditional indirect effects using a Monte Carlo
simulation with 10,000 replications to construct confidence intervals around the estimates (Bauer, Preacher, & Gil, 2006). As
shown in Table 7, the indirect relationship between daily C19 task
setbacks and next-day withdrawal behavior via end-of-day exhaustion was most positive and significant for employees whose task
interdependence was higher (vs. lower) and whose perceived organizational telework task support was lower (vs. higher), where
its 95% CIs [.001, .042] did not include zero. Adopting the
subgroup approach by Edwards and Lambert (2007), we tested the
significance of the moderated mediation by comparing the indirect
effects between two subgroups in which the two moderators had
opposing values (i.e., higher interdependence and lower support
group vs. lower interdependence and higher support group). The
difference was significant with 95% CIs [.002, .043], thus supporting H5.

Finally, we conducted supplemental analyses and estimated two
models (see Table 8) in which we switched the stages of the two
moderators (Model 5) or included both moderators at both stages
(Model 6). Both models supported general task interdependence as
a significant first-stage but not second-stage moderator and organizational telework support as a significant second-stage but not
first-stage moderator.

Discussion
Theoretical and Practical Implications
Our findings have several theoretical and practical implications, and we discuss them jointly. First, amid the upheaval set

off by the COVID-19 crisis, our research was a timely attempt
that examined the work-related psychological implications of
the new telework norm brought about by the pandemic. Prior
research has associated telework with beneficial outcomes for
employees and organizations (Allen et al., 2015; Gajendran &
Harrison, 2007). Our research, on the other hand, was based on
a unique form of telework that was rather abruptly imposed on
employees as a mandatory precautionary measure in light of the
pandemic instead of a flexi-work option. The results uncovered
potential difficulties and detriments that employees, especially
those with higher task interdependence, may face as they tackle
unforeseen and unfamiliar daily task setbacks (i.e., C19 task
setbacks) while being confined to working from home, physically distantly from their coworkers. Thus, we have identified a

forces and taking multipronged approaches to fight the pandemic during this period. Our research therefore highlighted
additional sources of constraints worthy of examination by
organizational researchers.

Limitations, Future Directions, and Conclusion

emotional exhaustion at different levels of task interdependence.

specific group of employees (i.e., those with higher interdependence) who are deserving of greater attention and support when
transitioning to telework.
Second, we shed light on a new aspect of telework, that is, the
use of telework as a crisis response. Our results highlighted the
need for further research to understand how to assist organizations and employees to transition smoothly and promptly to
telework without compromising on their well-being and performance. This is especially relevant both during and after the
pandemic because some organizations have expressed an intent
to implement permanent telework for their employees after the
pandemic (Heater, 2020; Rooney, 2020). As the circumstances
surrounding large-scale telework may be different (i.e., hasty
switch during pandemic vs. planned effort at a later time), we
recommend future research to tease out nuances in the construct
of telework, such as voluntary versus mandatory telework,
planned versus unplanned implementation, partial versus fulltime telework, and independent versus interdependent tasks, in
order to gain greater insights into how to best execute and
facilitate telework.
Third, our results extended past COR findings by showing
that exhausted employees could also draw from external resources (i.e., organizational telework task support) for replenishment. This should encourage further research on cross-level
and cross-domain mechanisms of resource exchange (Hobfoll et
al., 2018), as these might generate findings to help organizations develop effective interventions for sustaining engaged and
resilient employees. Practically, our findings highlighted the
need for organizations to provide telework task support for
exhausted telework employees who face unanticipated daily
C19 task setbacks, especially those whose jobs require higher
interdependence.
In addition, we opened a potential avenue for future research
on organizational constraints. Conventional organizational constraints (Pindek & Spector, 2016) largely refer to situational
obstacles within the organization that inhibit employees from
performing optimally, such as machine malfunctions or poor
information flow (Spector & Jex, 1998). C19 task setbacks, in
contrast, are broader and arise from more complex and dynamic
origins that could be intraorganizational, extraorganizational, or
both, as various internal and external stakeholders may join

We acknowledge several limitations in our research. First, although our sample of participants from diverse occupations and
industries allowed us to achieve variance in general task interdependence and organizational telework task support for testing our
hypotheses, we recognize that this could also be a limitation
because we did not specifically measure or control for the readiness of companies or industries in shifting to telework. Participants
from telework-ready companies may feel more equipped to tackle
daily C19 task setbacks while they work from home. This can lead
to a restricted range of task setbacks as they work from home.
Future research can consider studying industrial or organizational
characteristics to generate practical insights for specific industries
or organizations.
Second, we assessed organizational telework task support based
on employee perceptions. This allowed us to establish the importance of perceived organizational telework task support for helping
employees overcome daily exhaustion, but it did not shed light on
the exact content of effective organizational telework support
strategies. Future research can endeavor to develop a checklist of
telework task support strategies (Andriessen, 2007) and conduct a
field experiment (Eden, 2017) to test their effectiveness.
Third, we could not include all conceivable resource-related
variables linked to the pandemic and telework into our model. For
instance, telework success may be determined in part by the
resources that employees have at home, such as Internet connectivity and decent workspace (Allen et al., 2015). Employees from
more affluent backgrounds tend to have greater access to these
resources (Desilver, 2020), and thus future research could seek to
identify vulnerable employees or include socioeconomic background as a control variable.
Finally, we acknowledge that our model is a complex one that
included eight variables, a mediating chain, and two cross-level moderations. Saylors and Trafimow (2020) warned that complex models

have a lower likelihood of being true because it is more difficult for
the large number of correlations in its matrix to possess the right
causal status. It will therefore be beneficial to unpack our model in
future and test each relationship individually using lab or field experiments where possible to establish causality.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that daily C19 task setbacks are
positively related to next-day work withdrawal behavior via endof-day emotional exhaustion, especially for telework employees
who have higher task interdependence with coworkers and perceive lower organizational telework task support. This investiga-

Using the subgroup approach (Edwards & Lambert, 2007), indirect effects at higher (⫹1 SD) and lower (⫺1 SD) values of the moderators were compared
to the hypothesized strongest indirect effect at higher task interdependence and lower organizational telework task support.
