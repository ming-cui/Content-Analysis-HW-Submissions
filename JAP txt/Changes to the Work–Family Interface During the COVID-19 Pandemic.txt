Employees around the world have experienced sudden, significant changes in their work and family roles
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, applied psychologists have limited understanding of how
employee experiences of work–family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what
organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal crises. Adopting a
person-centered approach, we examine transitions in employees’ work–family interfaces from before
COVID-19 to after its onset. First, in Study 1, using latent profile analysis (N ⫽ 379; nonpandemic data),
we identify profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment, including beneficial (low conflict and high
enrichment), active (medium conflict and enrichment), and passive (low conflict and enrichment). In
Study 2, with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we replicate Study 1 profiles
and explore whether employees transition between work–family profiles during the pandemic. Results
suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles, positive (from active/passive to beneficial)
and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of
respondents. People were more likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation
preferences, engaged in emotion-focused coping, experienced higher technostress, and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn, negative transitions were associated with negative employee consequences
during the pandemic (e.g., lower job satisfaction and job performance, and higher turnover intent). We
discuss implications for future research and for managing during societal crises, both present and future.

conflict (i.e., incompatibility between work and family; Greenhaus
& Beutell, 1985) and enrichment (i.e., positive spillover between
work and family; Greenhaus & Powell, 2006), which are linked to
employee attitudes and behavior (Amstad, Meier, Fasel, Elfering,
& Semmer, 2011; McNall, Nicklin, & Masuda, 2010). Thus, it is
critical to identify factors that affect transitions in the WF interface
during this macro crisis and the implications for employee attitudes and behavior.
Because the extent and influence of the pandemic on the WF
interface are unknown, critical questions abound: What were typical patterns of WF conflict and enrichment before the pandemic?
How have patterns shifted during this event? While some people
may fare worse (i.e., greater conflict and/or less enrichment), do
others fare better (i.e., reduced conflict and/or greater enrichment)?
What personal and work factors predict changes to the WF interface after the onset of COVID-19? Finally, what are the implications of these profile transitions during the COVID-19 event for
worker attitudes and behaviors?
This research aims to address these questions, contributing to
the literature in novel ways. First, organizational research, and WF
scholarship specifically, has typically ignored societal crises (Kim

The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of workers
worldwide. As the pandemic unfolded and social distancing occurred, workers lost jobs (Beer, 2020; Tozzi, 2020), faced job
insecurity (Blustein et al., 2020), lost boundaries between work
and home (Fisher et al., 2020), and worried about their health and
that of their families (Prime, Wade, & Browne, 2020). Overnight,
workers began teleworking, many for the first time (Kramer &
Kramer, 2020). Such shifts likely impacted work–family (WF)

VAZIRI, CASPER, WAYNE, AND MATTHEWS

& Ployhart, 2014), a key oversight given the impact that events
such as manmade and natural disasters, pandemics, war, and
terrorism (Eby, Mitchell, & Zimmerman, 2016) can have on workers and families. Event systems theory (EST; Morgeson, Mitchell,
& Liu, 2015) argues that events that are novel, disruptive, and
critical result in changes in behavior, suggesting this is a key
omission. In this study we explore whether the novel, disruptive,
and critical event of COVID-19 is associated with changes in the
WF interface as well as job attitudes and behavior.
Second, we adopt a person-centered approach. A variablecentered approach examines levels of bidirectional conflict and
enrichment and their unique relationships with antecedents and
outcomes, providing important insight into between-person experiences. Although useful, there is also value in person-centered
methods to explore how combinations of variables define experiences for different people. Rather than examining conflict or
enrichment separately, person-centered methods detect profiles
that differ qualitatively or quantitatively in combinations of variables, offering novel insight (Wang & Hanges, 2011; Woo, Jebb,
Tay, & Parrigon, 2018). In this research, we use latent profile
analysis (LPA) to identify profiles of WF conflict and enrichment
(e.g., Moazami, Nurmi, Mauno, Aunola, & Rantanen, 2019; Rantanen, Kinnunen, Mauno, & Tement, 2013) during a period without a macro crisis (Study 1, November 2014) and then validate
these profiles with data from right before COVID-19 hit (Study 2,
February 2020), providing insight into WF profiles during routine
times.
Third, WF research often uses cross-sectional designs (Casper,
Eby, Bordeaux, Lockwood, & Lambert, 2007; Lapierre & McMullan, 2016), ignoring WF changes over time (Allen, French, Braun,
& Fletcher, 2019). Gathering data over time is vital to test whether
events foster change (Eby et al., 2016). A person-centered approach, combined with data collected before and during the pandemic, describes how people transition between profiles over time
to explore how COVID-19 impacts the WF interface. Bliese,
Adler, and Flynn (2017) have called for examining transitions
around discrete events with measures taken before and after an
event. To this end, in Study 2 we surveyed workers just before
COVID-19 hit the United States and again 6 weeks later. Applying
latent transition analysis (LTA), we capture the extent to which
peoples’ WF experiences changed for better or worse during
COVID-19.
Exploring intraperson transitions is important, given scholars
know little about how societal crises impact the WF interface (Eby
et al., 2016). Yet, it is also important to identify factors that
promote, and the consequences of, such transitions. As such, we
examine personal and work factors that explain why transitions
occur (Shipp & Cole, 2015) to provide insight into how employers
can reduce negative or promote positive effects of societal crises.
Finally, we assess how profile transitions relate to job attitudes and
behavior. As conflict and enrichment relate to many employee
outcomes (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, performance; Amstad et
al., 2011; McNall et al., 2010), we expect profile transitions to
relate to key outcomes, indicating why employers should support
workers during crisis events. Identifying outcomes associated with
profile transitions enables an accurate assessment of the risk employers face when employees struggle to manage the WF interface
during crisis events. Given the likely recurrence of COVID-19 and

other events like natural disasters or social unrest, our findings
provide important insights for both workers and employers.

Study 1: Establishing Work–Family Experience
Profiles
Studies of conflict and enrichment profiles are mixed in terms of
the number and type of profiles found. Some report four profiles of
active, passive, harmful, and beneficial (Moazami et al., 2019),
whereas others report three of active, beneficial, and contradictory
(Rantanen et al., 2013). Given mixed findings, in Study 1, we use
an inductive approach (Woo & Allen, 2014) to establish WF
profiles. A person-centered approach can identify quantitatively
distinct profiles that differ in levels of conflict and enrichment
(Spurk, Hirschi, Wang, Valero, & Kauffeld, 2020) as well as
qualitatively distinct profiles varying on relative standing of conflict and enrichment. For instance, one profile may include people
with high conflict and low enrichment, whereas another includes
low levels of conflict and enrichment. In Study 1, we explore WF
profiles with prepandemic data.
Research Question (RQ) 1: How many distinct conflict and
enrichment profiles are there and what is their nature?

Method
Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk) and were required to work at least 32 hr per week and live
in the United States (Bowling Green State University Institutional
Review Board [IRB] Protocol 680818; Wayne, Matthews, OdleDusseau, & Casper, 2019). Initially 620 respondents were
screened. Of these, 149 did not meet study qualification and were
not allowed to access the survey. Participants who failed one or
more of the attention-check items (N ⫽ 91) were omitted (Huang,
Curran, Keeney, Poposki, & DeShon, 2012). Listwise deletion of
missing data on conflict and enrichment (N ⫽ 1) resulted in 379
complete responses. Participants were primarily Caucasian (79%),
female (54%), and married/cohabiting (88%); 63% had children
living at home and they were, on average, 37 years old. Of
participants, 12% were in computer and mathematical occupations;
11% were in sales and related occupations; 10% were in education,
training, and library occupations; and the remaining participants
were working in a variety of other occupations, such as office and
administrative support, health care support, business and financial
operations, and so forth. Table 1 provides information on our
measures.
LPA was used to identify profiles (Morin, Morizot, Boudrias, &
Madore, 2011; Woo & Allen, 2014) using Mplus 7.4 (Muthen &
Muthen, 2015). Per Nylund, Asparouhov, and Muthén (2007), we
started with a model where two latent profiles were specified and
added profiles until there was no further improvement in model fit.
To compare model fit, we examined log likelihood (LL), Akaike
information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC),
sample-size-adjusted BIC (SSA–BIC), consistent AIC (CAIC),
Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR; Lo, Mendell, &
Rubin, 2001), and entropy. A best fitting model includes lower LL,
AIC, BIC, SSA–BIC, and CAIC, higher entropy, and significant
LMR (p ⬍ .05), indicating that the specified k-profile solution is
significantly better than the k-1-profile solution. Given these in-

dices are sometimes contradictory, we also used elbow plots of the
BIC and CAIC to examine where the curve flattens (Chawla,
MacGowan, Gabriel, & Podsakoff, 2020; Morin & Marsh, 2015).

Results
Table 2 provides descriptive information for study variables. Per
Table 3, although other solutions had lower LL, AIC, BIC, and
SSA-BIC, we retained the three-profile solution as LMR statistic for
the other solutions was not significant. In addition, the elbow plot of
BIC and CAIC (see Figure 1) shows that the slope of the curve
flattens around three profiles. Together, these visual and statistical
criteria suggest that there are three profiles in our data.
Table 4 and Figure 2 show means of bidirectional conflict and
enrichment for each profile. Most employees (59%) belonged to a
profile with low conflict and high enrichment. Given conflict is a
negative experience with negative consequences and enrichment is
positive, this high positive/low negative spillover profile is desirable;
we labeled it beneficial (Moazami et al., 2019). We labeled a second

profile of moderate conflict and enrichment (22%) active, and the
third profile of low conflict and enrichment (19%) was labeled passive (Moazami et al., 2019). Because passive and active profiles are a
mix of desirable (moderate enrichment or low conflict) and undesirable spillover (moderate conflict or low enrichment), they are less
desirable than the beneficial profile. Results suggest three quantitatively (passive and active) and qualitatively (beneficial) different
profiles (RQ1).

Study 2: Replicating and Exploring Transitions
Between Work–Family Profiles
In Study 2, we collected data before and during the COVID-19
pandemic. We first sought to replicate Study 1; we expected to find
the same three profiles.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): There are three WF conflict and enrichment profiles that differ quantitatively (passive and active)
and qualitatively (beneficial).

How Do Employees Transition Between Profiles
During COVID-19?
Employees are active agents in managing the work– home interface (Nippert-Eng, 1996), which has often been crafted with key
resources (e.g., childcare, eating out) to ensure it is manageable
(ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012). Some employees rely on
colleague support to stay efficient and keep work hours modest.
Others create boundaries between work and home to prevent
conflict (Ashforth, Kreiner, & Fugate, 2000; Bulger, Matthews, &
Hoffman, 2007). For many, the COVID-19 pandemic was a shock
to a carefully crafted WF interface. In the United States, after a
national health emergency was announced on March 13, 2020,
workers either worked from home, often using untried technology,
or in potentially unsafe workplaces with risk of exposure. According to EST, a novel, disruptive, and critical event like COVID-19
should have a major impact on employee perceptions and behav-

iors, including the WF interface. Bliese et al. (2017) noted that
events evoking a transition response should be studied by contrasting measures before the event and shortly after it. Relative to right
before, this novel event (COVID-19) disrupted work and home,
likely creating a transition response. As such, we expect negative
transitions toward greater conflict and/or lower enrichment between work and home, reflected in transitions from beneficial to
active or passive profiles.
Yet despite the stresses of COVID-19, with many obligations
paused, some workers may face an improved WF interface. As
social distancing ended long commutes and social obligations, the
pace of life slowed for some. Remote work can reduce exposure to
issues exacerbated by on-site work (e.g., toxic colleagues), and
some workloads may decrease. Consistent with EST, suggesting
people react differently to the same macroevent (Morgeson et al.,
2015), some workers may experience lower interference and

greater positive spillover and as such, transition to more desirable
profiles (i.e., from active or passive to beneficial).
RQ2: How do employees transition between profiles of work–
family conflict and enrichment following the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic?

What Factors Relate to Transitions Between Profiles?
Although we expect some employees experience positive, and
others negative profile transitions, there are several factors, including personal (segmentation preferences, coping), work demands
(technostress), and resources (family supportive supervision,
leader compassion) that may predict whether and how people
transition between profiles during societal crisis events.

Segmentation preference. People differ in whether they prefer to keep home and work separate (segmentors) or integrate
across roles (integrators; Nippert-Eng, 1996). Because integrators
prefer weak boundaries between work and home and have experience integrating roles as required by remote work, COVID-19
should be less novel or disruptive, so they should face similar or
even less conflict and higher enrichment, moving to (or staying in)
a beneficial profile. In contrast, because remote work does conflicts with segmentors’ desire to separate work and home, and they
may have less experience integrating roles, segmentors should
experience more conflict and less enrichment, moving to (or staying in) active or passive profiles.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Those with lower segmentation preference
are more likely to transition to or stay in the beneficial profile.
Coping strategy. Stress involves a cognitive appraisal, so
how a person views a stressor event is vital to a person’s response
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). There are a variety of strategies
people may use to cope with crisis events. Problem-focused coping
is an active form of coping in which people reduce or remove a
stressor though problem-solving, cost– benefit analysis, and time
management (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). It is negatively related
to WF conflict (Lapierre & Allen, 2006; Mauno & Rantanen,
2013) and positively related to role engagement and cross-domain
enrichment (Mauno, Rantanen, & Tolvanen, 2014). As such, it
should relate to a transition to (or staying in) a beneficial profile.
Emotion-focused coping, a passive form of coping, tries to “reduce
stress through emotional responses, self-preoccupation, and fantasizing.” It is less adaptive (Austenfeld & Stanton, 2004, p. 1339)
and associated with more WF conflict (Rantanen, Mauno, Kinnunen, & Rantanen, 2011). Thus, people who use emotion-focused
coping should transition to (or stay in) the active profile.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Those higher in problem-focused coping
are more likely to transition to or stay in the beneficial profile.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Those higher in emotion-focused coping
are more likely to transition to or stay in the active profile.

Parker, 2020). When ICT is introduced to support telework,
training on technology fosters adjustment (Lautsch, Kossek, &
Eaton, 2009), but such training was likely not possible with the
sudden onset of COVID-19. When employees must use new
technology without preparation, they may experience technostress (Ragu-Nathan, Tarafdar, Ragu-Nathan, & Tu, 2008) such
as technology overload, invasion, and incompatibility. Technology overload refers to pressure “to work faster and longer,”
whereas technology invasion refers to feeling a need to be
available at all times, blurring boundaries between work and
home (Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu-Nathan, & Ragu-Nathan, 2007).
Technology incompatibility refers to a perception that new
technology does not fit one’s needs (Moore & Benbasat, 1991).
These forms of technostress can foster inefficiency and blur WF
boundaries (e.g., work e-mails after business hours), such that
employees experience more WF conflict (Butts, Becker, &
Boswell, 2015; Chen & Karahanna, 2018; Leung & Zhang,
2017). As such, people who experience greater technostress
should transition to (or stay in) active profiles.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Those who experience higher levels of
technostress, including (1) overload, (2) invasion, and (3)

incompatibility are more likely to transition to or stay in the
active profile.
Leader behavior. Leaders are key sources of support employees may use to cope with stressors like COVID-19. Leaders who
engage in family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSBs) help employees manage work and family roles (Crain & Stevens, 2018),
fostering lower conflict or higher enrichment (Hammer, Kossek,
Yragui, Bodner, & Hanson, 2009; Odle-Dusseau, Britt, & GreeneShortridge, 2012). FSSBs are critical during societal crises when
people face more family demands. Thus, employees with access to
FSSBs during COVID-19 are more likely to transition to or stay in a
beneficial profile. Similarly, when workers face anxiety over COVID19, a compassionate supervisor who empathizes and recognizes employee concerns can relieve stress and generate positive emotions
(Davenport, 2015; Dutton, Workman, & Hardin, 2014; Peng, Chen,
Xia, & Ran, 2017), resulting in less conflict and greater enrichment
(i.e., staying in or transitioning to the beneficial profile).
Hypothesis 6 (H6): Those with leaders exhibiting higher (1)
FSSBs and (2) compassion are more likely to transition to or
stay in the beneficial profile.

What Are the Implications of Profile Transitions?
Transitions in WF profiles during societal crisis should have
implications for work attitudes (job satisfaction, commitment, and
turnover intentions) and job performance (organizational citizenship behaviors [OCBs] and in-role performance). The beneficial
profile (i.e., low conflict with high enrichment) is the most desirable given the greater positive and fewer negative experiences
across work and family (Demerouti & Geurts, 2004; J. Rantanen et
al., 2013); thus, this profile should relate to most positive outcomes. Accordingly, transitioning from a passive or active to
beneficial profile during a crisis event should drive positive employee outcomes.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): Those who transition from passive or
active profiles to beneficial experience more positive changes—
higher (1) job satisfaction, (2) organizational commitment, (3)
OCBs, and (4) job performance, and lower (5) turnover intentions during the crisis. Conversely, those who transition from
beneficial to passive or active experience more negative
changes.
The implications of transition between active and passive profiles are more equivocal. People transitioning from a passive to an

active profile encounter both more enrichment (desirable) and
more conflict (undesirable). Likewise, when they transition from
an active to a passive profile, they experience both less conflict and
less enrichment. Thus, it is not clear whether increased conflict
outweighs increased enrichment or vice versa. The one study
comparing passive and active profiles on employee outcomes (i.e.,
turnover intentions; Moazami et al., 2019) did not find differences
between these two groups. Accordingly, we pose a research question.
RQ3: What are the implications of transitioning between
passive and active profiles in terms of employee outcomes?

Method
Participants, design, procedures, and measures. The data
presented for this study were part of a broader data collection
effort conducted at Wake Forest University under IRB Protocol
00023673 (Project Title: “Balance Scale Construct Validation and

a widespread concern. Initially 1,468 respondents were screened.
Of these, 303 did not meet study qualification and were not
allowed to access the survey. Participants who failed one or more
of attention-check items (N ⫽ 564) or completed the survey in less
than 7.5 min (N ⫽ 1; average response time of 23 min) were
omitted. Listwise deletion of missing data on conflict and enrichment (N ⫽ 17) resulted in 583 complete respondents, who were
primarily Caucasian (85%), female (57%), and married/cohabiting
(62%). Most (61%) had children. They were, on average, 54
(SD ⫽ 11.00) years old and worked 42.25 (SD ⫽ 6.67) hr each
week. Of participants, 17% were in education, training, and library
occupations; 14% were in health care support and technical occupations; 7% were in office and administrative support occupations;
and the remaining participants were working in a variety of other
occupations, such as production and manufacturing, business and
financial operations, management, and so forth.
The COVID-19 crisis presented an opportunity to conduct a
naturally occurring quasi-experiment using a one-group pretest–
posttest design (Cook & Campbell, 1979). On February 21, approximately 1 week after we completed W1 data collection, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated no
community spread but were preparing for this possibility. On
March 13, a national health emergency was declared, calling for
social distancing, sending thousands of Americans home to work
remotely. By March 26, the United States led the world in number
of COVID-19 cases; on March 27, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed, and on April 1,
the United States had over 200,000 cases of COVID-19. When we
began Wave 2 (W2) data collection in the first week of April, the
United States was in a major societal crisis.
Of the 583 W1 respondents, 508 completed the W2 survey
(response rate: 85%). Those who failed attention checks (N ⫽ 26)
or completed the survey in less than 10 min at W2 (N ⫽ 8; average
response time of 40 min) were omitted, for a sample of 474. Of
these, 71 (15%) lost their job or were missing work due to
COVID-19 and were omitted.1 Listwise deletion of missing data
on conflict and enrichment resulted in a final sample of 371
workers who were primarily Caucasian (86%), female (54%), and
married/cohabiting (63%). Most (63%) had children. They were,
on average, 54 years old. The W2 sample worked an average of
42.37 and 38.32 hr per week at W1 and W2, respectively. We
collected conflict, enrichment, and employee outcomes at both
waves. Personal and work-related factors (i.e., segmentation preference, coping, technostress, and leader behaviors) were collected
at W2. Table 1 provides information on our measures.
Analytical approach. As in Study 1, LPAs were conducted to
identify conflict and enrichment profiles based on W1 data (N ⫽
583). We used W1 data because a larger sample size would
provide more confidence replicating results due to smaller standard errors. We then used LTA (Collins & Lanza, 2009; Nylund et
al., 2007) on matched data from W1 and W2 (N ⫽ 371) to examine
the probability of profile transition. We first examined the longitudinal invariance of profiles across two waves, which suggested
the same number and type of profiles, ⌬␹2(12) ⫽ 11.46, p ⫽ .49
(Satorra, 2000). We used the invariance model to explore transition probabilities between profiles over time. To test H2 through
H6 (i.e., predicting transitions), we calculated conditional transition probabilities (Muthén & Asparouhov, 2011) at high and low
levels of each predictor (⫾1 SD). We used the delta method

(Raykov & Marcoulides, 2004) to examine whether conditional
transition probabilities differed from one another at different levels
of each predictor. Finally, we used paired-sample t tests to compare changes in outcomes for those who transitioned between
profiles. For the hypotheses, we used an alpha of .05; but to
examine the research questions, we used a Bonferroni correction
(␣ ⫽ .005).

Results
Step 1: Replicating profiles. Descriptive statistics and correlations are reported in Table 5, and fit statistics for alternative
latent profile structures in Table 3. As in Study 1, we selected the
three-profile solution because it had lower LL, AIC, BIC, and
SSA-BIC compared to the two-profile solution, in addition to
significant LMR. In addition, elbow plot of BIC and CAIC (see
Figure 1) suggested the curve flattened after the three-profile
solution. Table 4 details the mean levels of conflict and enrichment
for each profile. The three profiles corresponded with beneficial
(54%), active (15%), and passive (31%) profiles found in Study 1,
supporting H1. Notably, though not identical, the means are similar across our two samples.
Step 2: Transitions between profiles. Table 6 provides the
transition probabilities of each profile before and during the
COVID-19 crisis. Each cell represents the probability that a person
transitions from (or stays in) a profile in W1 to a different (or
same) profile in W2. For example, the first cell indicates that if a
person belonged to the active profile at W1, it is 82% likely they
remained in that profile at W2. Whereas employees were 82%,
75%, and 87% likely to remain in the active, passive, and beneficial profiles, respectively, they were 19%, 25%, and 13% likely to
transition to another profile at W2. The largest probability of
transition was from passive to active (16%), followed by those
who transitioned from active (11%) and beneficial (11%) to passive profile. The lowest probability of transition was from beneficial to active profile (2%). While these numbers may seem
relatively small, transitioning between profiles (e.g., from passive
to active) is a dramatic change as it requires simultaneous shifts in
1
Attrition analyses suggested that those who did not respond to W2
reported higher WFC, FWC, and turnover intentions at W1. Also, those
who lost jobs during the crisis reported higher turnover intentions at W1.
In consideration of the potential for selective attrition bias, we conducted
LTA using inverse probability weights as a function of bidirectional
conflict and enrichment at W1 (for a similar approach, see Lang & Kell,
2019). Results were generally consistent with findings reported here (except for technology incompatibility), suggesting limited influence of selective attrition on our findings. Results are reported in Table S1 in online
supplemental material.

both conflict and enrichment. For example, about 40% of the
sample experienced higher work-to-family conflict (WFC; ranging
between .2 and 3.6; ⌬M ⫽ .78, p ⬍ .05) and another 38% reported
lower WFC (ranging between ⫺.2 and ⫺2.8; ⌬M ⫽ ⫺.76, p ⬍
.05) during the pandemic. We observed similar trends for family
to-work conflict (FWC), work-to-family enrichment (WFE), and
family to-work enrichment (FWE). However, only extreme
changes in both conflict and enrichment at the same time foster
profile transition (e.g., average decrease of 1.82 and 1.78 units in
WFC and FWC, respectively, with an average increase of .69 and
.65 units in WFE and FWE to transition from active to beneficial
profile). Given this, and in response to RQ2, the extent of profile
transitions suggests there were major simultaneous shifts in WF
conflict and enrichment from W1 to W2 for some respondents.
Notably, there were both positive (i.e., from active/passive to
beneficial) and negative (i.e., from beneficial to active/passive)
transitions during the COVID-19 event.
Step 3: Predicting transitions. Table 7 details conditional
transition probabilities for each predictor. For segmentation preferences, though there was no difference in transition probabilities
from passive to beneficial profiles, those with lower preferences
for segmentation were more likely to transition from active to
beneficial profiles (a positive transition, .11, p ⬍ .05) compared
with those with higher preferences for segmentation (.03, p ⬎ .05),
partially supporting H2. There was no difference in any conditional transition probabilities for higher and lower levels of
problem-focused coping; H3 was not supported. Those with higher
emotion-focused coping were more likely to transition from beneficial to active profiles (.28, p ⬍ .05) compared with those lower
in emotion-focused coping (.03, p ⬎ .05), partially supporting H4.
For technostress, those reporting higher technology overload
and technology invasion were more likely to have a negative
transition from beneficial to active profile (overload: .28, p ⬍ .05;
invasion: .24, p ⬍ .05) compared to those with lower technology
overload and invasion (overload: .01, p ⬎ .05; invasion: .03, p ⬎
.05). Further, those whose technology was less compatible with
their work were more likely to transition from beneficial to passive
profile (.24, p ⬍ .05), providing some support for H5. Employees
with supervisors lower on FSSB were more likely to transition
from active to passive profiles (.27, p ⬍ .05). In contrast, those
with more compassionate leaders were more likely to transition
from passive to beneficial profiles (a positive transition, .22, p ⬍
.05) and those with less compassionate leaders were more likely to
transition from beneficial to active profiles (a negative one, .18,
p ⬍ .05), partially supporting H6.
Step 4: Implications of transitions. Table 8 provides means
and standard deviations of employee outcomes across profiles over
time. Table 9 includes paired-sample t tests for changes in outcomes across transition groups. Transitioning from active or passive to beneficial profiles (a positive transition) was associated
with more job satisfaction, and commitment, and lower turnover
intent, while transitioning from beneficial to active profile (negative transition) was associated with lower job satisfaction and
performance, and more turnover intentions, partially supporting
H7. For RQ3, we compared outcomes for transitioning between
active and passive profiles using a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha value
of .005. However, we did not find significant changes in any
outcomes when employees transitioned between these two profiles.

Post hoc analyses. We conducted post hoc analyses to examine gender and parental status as predictors of WF profiles (see
Table S2 in the online supplemental material) but could not detect
differences in conditional transition probabilities. One trend was
that men were 90% likely, and women 56% likely, to remain in the
active profile. Yet this seemingly large difference was not statistically significant, suggesting inadequate power.

Discussion
In this study, we explored changes to employees’ WF interface
during the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis, the personal and job
factors related to WF changes, and how WF changes relate to job
attitudes and performance. Our findings related to the COVID-19
event may offer insight into similar macrolevel crises, including a
second wave of COVID-19, other pandemics which are expected
to occur more often in the future (World Economic Forum, 2019),
or potentially natural disasters and major social unrest. The current
study sheds light on how employers and employees can better
manage the WF interface during challenging events and contributes to a sparse body of research linking macrolevel events to
individual well-being, attitudes, and behavior (Kim & Ployhart,
2014).
We accomplish these aims by taking a person-centered approach, identifying three WF profiles (Wang & Hanges, 2011;
Woo et al., 2018)––beneficial (low conflict and high enrichment),
active (medium conflict and enrichment), and passive (low conflict
and enrichment). Although our profiles slightly differ from past

research (Moazami et al., 2019; Rantanen et al., 2013), we replicated them in two data sets. A key question is whether such
profiles change with societal events. Our results suggest that the
number and nature of profiles may endure but that, as we discuss
next, some people move to a new profile during macro events.
However, it is not clear whether findings generalize beyond our
sample (e.g., older employees) or study design (e.g., 6-week time
lag), warranting future research.
Second, by collecting data before and during the COVID-19
pandemic as suggested by Bliese et al. (2017), we shed light on
how employees’ WF interfaces change during a macrolevel crisis,
a topic on which there has been little empirical study (Eby et al.,
2016). EST suggests that events that are novel, disruptive, and
critical create behavior changes. By extension, we argue that
COVID-19, as a negative exogenous event with these characteristics, should affect the WF interface. Consistent with EST, our
results show that within a few weeks of the COVID-19 crisis,
many, though not all employees, experienced shifts in the WF
interface in terms of the combination of conflict and enrichment
(Fisher et al., 2020; Kramer & Kramer, 2020). Transitions from
some profiles were more likely (i.e., passive) than were others (i.e.,
beneficial). People with little conflict or enrichment (i.e., passive)
before COVID-19 were more likely to face greater conflict and
enrichment, transitioning to the active profile. In other words,
people who started off in an undesirable low-activation profile
were likely to transition to an undesirable high-activation profile
during the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to EST, this is consistent

Note. Prior to event recommendations are based on the findings of the study during the crisis event. These recommendations help employers plan and
lay the foundation in advance of a societal crisis.

with conservation of resources (COR; Hobfoll, 1989) theory’s
application to traumatic events (those that are unexpected, make
excessive demands, are outside resource utilization strategies, etc.)
which are particularly threatening and result in rapid resource
depletion (Hobfoll, 1991).
Importantly, people with a beneficial profile (low conflict and
high enrichment) often sustained this profile, even after the onset
of COVID-19, counter to anecdotal reports of the widespread,
disruptive nature of COVID-19 to the WF interface. These findings have at least three important implications. First, the stability
of the beneficial profiles suggests that societal crisis does not
always translate into personal crisis (Eby et al., 2016) and consistent with EST, people may interpret the same event differently
(Morgeson et al., 2015). Second, these findings are perhaps best
explained by COR theory’s tenets of resource gain spirals (Hobfoll, 1989). The continuity of many beneficial profiles suggests
that most people who fared well before the pandemic were able to
avert significant distress at least during the initial stages of this
event, perhaps due to coping or other resources, which are critical
to recovery from natural disasters (Benight et al., 1999). COR
theory suggests that people with more resources are better positioned to protect resources during adverse events (Hobfoll, 1989,
2011). In this study, before the pandemic, people in the beneficial
profile had the resources to manage WF demands. The ability to
invest resources to foster resource gain spirals once the pandemic
hit seemingly enabled them to avert an undesirable profile transition. Merging theory with practice, these results reinforce arguments that employer-provided WF support is always vital, not only
during crisis events. By proactively supporting WF needs, employers can better position employees to navigate WF roles effectively
before and during macrolevel crisis events (see Table 10). A final
implication is the importance of studying events before and after
their onset (Bliese et al., 2017) given much “disaster research”
only examines people’s responses over time after an event (e.g.,
Benight et al., 1999). Our research indicates that people’s tendencies to change profiles during societal crisis differed depending on
whether they started in a relatively resource rich (beneficial) or
resource poor (passive) profile, shedding new light on principles of
COR.

In light of the EST notion that people differ in their reactions to
macro events (Morgeson et al., 2015), we go beyond describing
WF profile transitions to examine personal and work factors that
predict such transitions to guide employers on best practices.
Emotion-focused coping, technology overload, and technology
invasion were associated with transition from a beneficial to an
active profile (a negative transition). Yet, a compassionate leader
was associated with a positive transition from a passive to beneficial profile. Perhaps because of their comfort integrating work
and home, employees with lower segmentation preferences (i.e.,
integrators) were more likely to benefit during COVID-19 by
transitioning from an active to beneficial profile. Employees
whose leaders exhibited fewer FSSBs were more likely to transition from an active to passive profile but showed no transition
to/from beneficial profiles. While unexpected, perhaps supervisors
who exhibit FSSBs after the onset of COVID-19 also did so
prepandemic; thus, no transition might be observed. Future research should examine this possibility.
Collectively, our results suggest ways employees and employers
(see Table 10) might improve the negative effects of macrolevel
crises. Employers that identify technology-related needs, provide
technology training in advance, and offer technology support during periods of turmoil might offset the negative effects of technostress. Likewise, employers can train supervisors on the importance of compassion, and develop “employee health first” plans to
help workers manage work and family. These actions may especially be needed by people who use emotion-focused coping or
prefer segmentation, as they are likely to face more adverse
changes in the WF interface.
Our research also highlights why employees and employers
should care about workers’ WF struggles. As expected, negative
transitions (i.e., from beneficial to active/passive) have negative
effects on worker outcomes. Yet, we found no changes in outcomes with transitions between passive and active profiles, perhaps due to small samples (and low power) in transition groups.
Future research may explore the nuances of conflict and enrichment profiles in terms of employee outcomes, but our study
suggests that conflict and enrichment should be considered in
tandem to explore how combinations of these variables relate to

key outcomes. Still, we suggest that employers who offer instrumental (e.g., technology support) and emotional (e.g., compassion)
support to employees during adverse events should help them
manage work and family, and benefit with better employee attitudes and behaviors.
As with any study, ours has limitations. Our data come from
workers recruited via MTurk and Qualtrics. Although our samples
included many industries, findings may not generalize to all people. Notably, most Study 2 participants had grown children rather
than young children, so findings may not generalize to parents of
young children. We explored effects of gender, parental status, and
children at home but did not find differences in transition probabilities, likely due to low power. Thus, we encourage future
research to include strata of participants with young children. More
than half of our participants changed from onsite to remote work
during COVID-19. However, our data did not differentiate people
without a change in work location by remote versus onsite work
with risk of exposure to COVID-19, so we could not examine
effects of high-risk work, another important area for future research. Also, a 6-week lag was chosen in part due to time needed
to update the study protocol and obtain IRB approval. Shorter or
longer lags may have identified distinct profile transition relationships. Further, predictors were only collected at W2; however, the
use of pre–post data for other variables reduces common method
variance concerns. Although we had systematic attrition, attrition
analyses suggested little influence on results, except for technology incompatibility findings, which should be interpreted cautiously.
Finally, our analytical methods (i.e., LPA and LTA) have their
own criticisms. Notably, these methods are prone to interpretation
bias in identifying profiles (Morin, Meyer, Creusier, & Biétry,
2016), and overextraction of profiles and alternative explanation of
population heterogeneity (Bauer & Curran, 2003a, 2003b). Beyond
that, these techniques are sample-specific and require relatively
large heterogeneous samples to be stable and generalizable (Woo
et al., 2018). However, to deal with concerns about samplespecific findings, we replicated our profiles across two distinct
samples. That said, although a variable-centered approach could be
used to examine the combination of conflict and enrichment (i.e.,
via interaction terms), we are unaware of a variable-centered
approach that would allow us to examine such combinations as
outcomes, as done here. Given the nature of our research questions
(e.g., examining profile transitions during a societal crisis), LPA
and LTA were appropriate analytical tools to provide novel insights (Cudeck & Henly, 2003). Still, we see these challenges as
areas of opportunities for future research. Researchers may wish to
collect additional waves of data with even larger samples of
respondents during societal-crisis events. This would allow scholars to replicate the profiles and profile transitions found here.
In short, the current study explores how societal crises impact
employees’ WF interface. Employees who transition to a more
negative WF profile during such events have more negative job
attitudes and report fewer positive work behaviors. As such, employers have good reason to help workers manage work and home
during societal turmoil. Those that offer emotional support from
compassionate supervisors and instrumental support for new technology may ease WF transitions and benefit with committed
employees who remain long after societal turmoil passes.
