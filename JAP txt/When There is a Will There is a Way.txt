The global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted personal and work lives and created great uncertainty and
stress, especially for frontline health care professionals like doctors and nurses who risk personal health
while facing increased workloads and new COVID-related tasks. People can passively respond to this
disruption, or they can be more active and choose to shape the conditions surrounding their work during the
crisis. We designed a multiwave, multisource study examining whether a proactive orientation is a key
resource for frontline health care professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from proactive and
conservation of resources theories, we studied a sample of 408 doctors and nurses at a COVID-19 hospital in
the locked-down area surrounding Wuhan City, China during the ﬁrst wave of the virus. Our aim is to
examine how personal agency contributes to health care professionals’ performance and well-being when
combating COVID-19. Proactive personality as a dispositional resource was associated with higher levels of
perceived strengths use, a job-related motivational resource. This effect was jointly moderated by routine
disruption and perceived organizational support. Proactive personality was indirectly associated with
performance and two indicators of well-being (resilience and thriving) through perceived strengths use.
More frequent physical exposure to the virus magniﬁed the effects of perceived strengths use on an archival
indicator of performance during the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic.
Keywords: COVID-19, proactive personality, conservation of resources, strengths use, well-being

brought by the pandemic (Restubog et al., 2020). Health care
professionals working at the vanguard of this new and overwhelming situation had little information about the virus or its effective
treatment; many had to identify new tasks, responsibilities, and
work structures during the crisis. Because of a lack of expertise,
many health care professionals with specialties in areas other than
respiratory infections were required to instantly change their focus
to treating COVID-19 patients, facing uncertainty and risk of
infection (Liu et al., 2020). Success in the face of such an uncertain
and challenging context calls for considerable personal initiative in
exploring effective ways of work while maintaining an adequate
level of psychological well-being. Accordingly, we draw from
theories of proactive personality and behavior to examine how the
personal agency helps deal with such uncertainty. We then utilize
the conservation of resources (COR) theory to better understand how
proactive personality contributes to performance and well-being
during this pandemic.
This study aims to provide several important contributions.
Perhaps most salient is directly tying the importance of an active
approach to work to performance and well-being for frontline
health care professionals during this uncertain time. The unique
nature of our sample, participants, and context provide a rich
opportunity for studying these relationships. Second, we broaden
the proactive personality literature by examining its role in coping
with uncertainty, crisis, and the underlying mechanisms involved.
Recent work has noted the negative implications for COVID-19 on
well-being (Sibley et al., 2020) and resilience (Prime et al., 2020).
Our research extends this by demonstrating the importance of

Theﬁeldof applied psychology haslong been interestedin identifying
factors associated with job performance and personal well-being intimes
of crisis (e.g., Chisholm et al., 1983; Hogan, 2020; Lindström &
Giordano, 2016; Stachowski et al., 2009). The current COVID-19
global pandemic (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020) is amplifying the importance of this topic, especially for frontline health care
professionals in the most active COVID-19 hotspots. Our objective is to
study how a proactive orientation facilitates the performance and wellbeing of frontline doctors and nurses (referred to as health care professionals hereafter) treating COVID-19 patients in locked-down greater

environment, ill-deﬁned situations, and the unpredictable future

proactive personality in creating a motivational resource to build
both. Third, we extend research on strengths use and its relationships with proactive personality and performance by utilizing a
research design that addresses the limitations of previous research.
van Woerkom, Mostert, et al. (2016) used a cross-sectional design
and urged future studies to employ longitudinal methods; furthermore, their subjective performance measure was collected before
the measurement of proactivity and strengths use. Our longitudinal
design allows more conﬁdence to be placed in the causal relationships. Fourth, we highlight COR as an integrative theoretical lens
for understanding how proactive personality affects outcomes by
considering how proactivity manifests itself through motivational job
resources. Finally, we examine the importance of three COVID-19related moderators: Routine disruption, perceived organizational
support, and physical exposure. This not only provides further
validation of how important proactive personality is during a crisis,
but also indicates that contextual differences in experiences during
the crisis play an important role in reactions to it (Figure 1a).

Theoretical Development and Hypotheses
Proactive personality is a trait-level behavioral tendency to actively
create environmental change; proactive people scan for and create
opportunities, demonstrate initiative, and persevere when facing
obstacles (Bateman & Crant, 1993). Proactives will view the
COVID-19 crisis not just as a threat, but also as an opportunity
to enact meaningful change and ﬁnd new and better ways of doing
work. We chose proactive personality as a focal variable because
of its ﬁt with coping with a crisis: It stresses agency (Bateman &
Crant, 1993), and proactivity is particularly important when facing
uncertainty (Grant & Ashford, 2008). Proactive people are motivated to reduce uncertainty (Ohly & Schmitt, 2017) by actively
anticipating future possibilities in external environments and acting in
self-directed ways (Grifﬁn et al., 2007).
Proactive personality has been directly and indirectly linked to a
variety of organizational outcomes (Crant et al., 2017). Theories of
proactive personality and behavior (e.g., Bateman & Crant, 1993;
Crant, 2000; Grant & Ashford, 2008; Parker et al., 2006) have
identiﬁed several mediating processes, which Parker et al. (2006)
refer to as cognitive-motivational states. The theories converge on
the notion that proactive personality manifests itself in behaviors
through these mediating states. The theories also note that contextual factors—such as boundary conditions surrounding work experiences during COVID-19—may supplement or mitigate the
effects of proactive personality on mediators and outcome variables
(Crant et al., 2017).
Because we study proactive personality in the context of COVID19, we also draw from the COR theory. This theory emphasizes the
role played by objective context—rather than perceptions of that
context—in resource use (Hobfoll et al., 2018). COVID-19 is one of
the most disruptive stressors in the health care domain, and it is a
powerful contextual inﬂuence on people. The COR theory holds that
people with more resources use them to protect against or recover
from losses and to gain additional resources (Hobfoll, 1989). Thus,
we expect proactive health care professionals (referred to as “proactives” hereafter) to create greater job-related motivational resources in
achieving goals of performance and well-being during COVID-19.
Speciﬁcally, we argue that proactives will generate job-related
motivational resources by creating opportunities to utilize their

strengths in the face of the crisis. Drawing from the positive
psychology research tradition and the work of Seligman and his
colleagues (e.g., Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Seligman
et al., 2005), strengths use refers to a person’s unique characteristics and abilities that, when activated, are energizing and permit
performance at one’s personal best (Linley & Harrington, 2006;
Wood et al., 2011). Following other scholars who have examined
strengths use in the world of work, we are interested in studying the
extent to which employees perceive that they can broadly use their
strengths (van Woerkom, Bakker, et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2011)
rather than identifying which speciﬁc signature character strengths
are most representative (Peterson & Seligman, 2004).
When employees engage in tasks capitalizing on their strengths,
they can achieve their goals in a more self-concordant way that
better ﬁts with their developing interests and core values as well as
enhances motivation (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999). Strengths use is
deﬁned as availing oneself of personal characteristics that are
energizing to the user (Linley & Harrington, 2006) and allow
people to perform at their personal best (Wood et al., 2011). It is a
job-related motivational resource because it facilitates the achievement of work-related behavioral goals such as higher performance
and lower absenteeism; furthermore, organizations should support
strengths use (e.g., van Woerkom, Bakker, et al., 2016; van
Woerkom & Meyers, 2015). Strengths use is a function of personality and job resources (Bakker & van Woerkom, 2018). Proactives
are more likely to use their strengths at work (Bakker & van
Woerkom, 2018; van Woerkom, Mostert, et al., 2016). The ambiguity and uncertainty faced by health care professionals during
the pandemic and the necessity of reinventing one’s job allows
proactives to create opportunities to capitalize on their best qualities. In highly routinized and structured situations, individuals may
have the limited latitude to craft a ﬁt between their strengths and
job responsibilities. However, in times of uncertainty and chaos
(e.g., combating COVID-19), individuals can view such ambiguities as opportunities for constructive change that capitalize on their
personal strengths. Accordingly, we propose that:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Proactive personality is positively related to
perceived strengths use among health care professionals.
We further argue that strengths use may serve as an important
mechanism explaining how proactives achieve better performance in the uncertain COVID-19 context. Proactives utilize
their strengths to establish a new order from the chaos in a way
that provides more opportunities to capitalize on their expertise
and ﬁt with their values (van Woerkom, Bakker, et al., 2016),
allowing them to work in a more motivated, self-concordant way
(Sheldon & Elliot, 1999). Previous theorizing and empirical
research suggest that strengths use is associated with higher
performance (Clifton & Harter, 2003; Linley et al., 2010; van
Woerkom, Mostert, et al., 2016). Employees are more likely to
accomplish goals when they engage in tasks capitalizing on their
strengths (van Woerkom, Bakker, et al., 2016). However, withdrawal behaviors (e.g., excessive work breaks and neglecting
important in-role tasks) can become more frequent in times of
crisis and uncertainty (Hermann, 1963; Hui & Lee, 2000). Yet,
when individuals utilize their strengths to obtain motivational
energy, they may be less likely to withdraw even when facing a

highly stressful environment like COVID-19. Lacking motivational
resources is associated with withdrawal behaviors; strengths use
is related to reduced withdrawal behaviors such as absenteeism
(Sliter et al., 2012; van Woerkom, Bakker, et al., 2016), probably
by providing necessary motivational resources. We thus propose
that proactives may have higher performance and lower withdrawal behaviors because of their higher levels of perceived
strengths use.
Hypothesis 2(H2): Proactive personality is (a) positively related
to the health care professionals’ performance through perceived
strengths use, and (b) negatively related to the health care
professional’s withdrawal behaviors through perceived strengths
use during the pandemic.
For health care professionals, disruptions and uncertainty bring
stress and challenges to not only their work but also their psychological well-being. For example, Liu et al.’s (2020) qualitative study
revealed that health care professionals taking care of patients infected
by COVID-19 face great emotional demands and a high risk of
emotional exhaustion. We argue that proactive personality as a
dispositional resource leads to securing more psychological resources that help sustain well-being during the stressful COVID-19
crisis.
Limited research has examined relationships between proactive
personality and well-being. Available evidence has shown that
proactive personality moderates the relationship between stressors
and well-being (Cunningham & De La Rosa, 2008), and the
relationship between proactive personality and well-being is mediated by job crafting and career competencies (Plomp et al., 2016).
Nonetheless, it is not clear whether and how proactive personality
may contribute to well-being in times of crisis and uncertainty.
We posit that perceived strengths use may serve as an important
mechanism through which proactives differentiate themselves
from their counterparts in maintaining high levels of psychological
well-being during the pandemic. Proactives may identify and create
self-concordant work situations, drawing from their best selves that
transcend the temporary difﬁculties. Strengths use, in turn, is associated with greater levels of psychological well-being (e.g., Bakker
et al., 2019; Govindji & Linley, 2007; Proctor et al., 2011; Wood
et al., 2011). As such, proactives may gain higher levels of psychological well-being through strengths use.
We examine two indicators of psychological well-being that are
particularly relevant to recovering from stress during the COVID-19
crisis: Resilience and thriving. Resilience refers to positive adjustment in the face of adversity (Carver, 1998; Hartmann et al., 2020),
which focuses on rebounding from threatening circumstances
(Masten & Reed, 2002; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003). A recent review
article (Hartmann et al., 2020) concluded that both dispositions and
personal resources predict resilience. Thriving refers to a sense of
vitality and learning, often when facing adversity (Carver, 1998;
Spreitzer et al., 2005); a recent meta-analysis (Kleine et al., 2019)
indicated that thriving is associated with proactive personality and
with positive attitudes toward self-development. Outbreaks of infectious diseases take a particularly strong toll on the well-being of
health care workers (Restubog et al., 2020). We argue that strengths
use can help proactives experience higher levels of resilience and
thriving during the stressful pandemic.

Hypothesis 3(H3): Proactive personality is positively related to
the health care professionals’ (a) resilience and (b) thriving
through perceived strengths use during the pandemic.

COVID-19-Related Moderators
To further understand the process by which proactive personality
leads to the outcome variables through perceived strengths use, we
examined three moderators chosen because of their particular relevance to the COVID-19 crisis and to our theoretical model: Routine
disruption, perceived organizational support, and physical exposure
to the virus. We ﬁrst consider potential moderators that may regulate
the relationships between proactive personality and strengths use,
followed by moderators of the relationships between strengths use
and the outcome variables.
In their model of proactive motivation, Parker et al. (2010)
theorized that three distinct motivational states affect one’s propensity to engage in proactive behaviors: “can do,” “reason to,”
and “energized to” motivations. In terms of creating situations
capitalizing on one’s strengths, proactive personality can be
considered a “can do” motivator; proactive personality reﬂects a
belief that one is able to change things for the better, and a tendency
to engage in proactive behaviors such as strengths use. But the
relationship between proactive personality and strengths use is also
affected by “reason to” and “energized to” motivational states.
Routine disruption can be considered a “reason to” motivational
force for proactive motivation (Parker et al., 2010); it reﬂects the
“why” rationale of pursuing proactive goals. In the pandemic
frontlines, one major challenge is the disruption of previously
comfortable routines. Many had to shift from their previous tasks
to a new role (Liu et al., 2020). Ambiguity triggers forwardthinking and self-starting behavior (Ohly & Schmitt, 2017);
thus, routine disruption is a contextual force providing a reason
that change is necessary. Additionally, people are more likely to
pursue proactive goals when they experience “energized to”
motivational states, such as activated positive affect (Parker
et al., 2010). Perceived organizational support is an important
condition conducive to positive mood states in organizational
settings, supported by meta-analytic evidence (Rhoades &
Eisenberger, 2002). Accordingly, perceived organizational support during the ﬁght against COVID-19 is a contextual variable
consistent with the “energized to” motivation to pursue proactive
goals, and compensates for the exhaustive nature of routine
disruption. Indeed, perceived organizational support during the
COVID-19 pandemic may be especially important given the
emergency nature of the task, the employees’ need for support,
and the tight supply of materials at that time. Even among people
working in the same organization, we expect differences in their
perceived organizational support because of the effects of leadership style and personal perceptual lenses. Together, these three
components of proactive motivation work in concert to form a
better understanding of the boundary conditions surrounding
proactive behaviors, including strengths use. Thus, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4(H4): There is a three-way interaction of proactive personality, routine disruption, and perceived organizational support in predicting perceived strengths use. The
positive relationship between proactive personality and perceived strengths use will be greater with more routine disruption

when the perceived organizational support from the hospital is
also higher.
We next considered a COVID-19-related boundary condition
affecting the relationships between strengths use and the outcome
variables. Aligned with the COR theory, we have proposed that
proactives accumulate additional job-related motivational resources consistent with their authentic selves by utilizing their
strengths (Bakker & van Woerkom, 2018; Peterson & Seligman,
2004) and obtaining mastery experiences (Bandura, 1997;
Peterson & Seligman, 2004) that ultimately lead to improved
performance and well-being. Routine disruption provides opportunities for strengths use, as described in H2a and H2b. Physical
exposure to the virus, on the other hand, is a unique COVID-19
contextual factor that signals the need to capitalize on the resources
built up through strengths use rather than creating more opportunities. It is a particular stressor that would exacerbate relationships
between strengths use and performance/well-being. Physical
exposure to the virus imposes considerable pressure and fear to
the health care professionals (Liu et al., 2020), requiring more
personal resources to deal with the work demands and the psychologically taxing situation. When facing demanding tasks,
greater job resources can facilitate performance and well-being
(Bakker & Demerouti, 2007, 2017; Demerouti et al., 2001). How
and when strengths are effectively used depends on context and
interests (Biswas-Diener et al., 2011). As such, we argue that when
facing high physical exposure to COVID-19, strengths use (as a
job resource) brings salient advantages leading to better performance and well-being. Therefore, we propose that:
Hypothesis 5(H5): The relationship between perceived strengths
use and (a) job performance, (b) withdrawal behaviors,
(c) resilience, and (d) thriving during the pandemic will be
moderated by physical exposure to the COVID-19 virus. The
positive effect will be enhanced when physical exposure is higher
for H5a, H5c, and H5d; the negative effect will be enhanced
when physical exposure is higher for H5b.

Method
Sample and Procedures
We collected data from a hospital in the locked-down area of
greater Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, which shifted from a
general hospital to a pneumonia specialist hospital to exclusively
treat COVID-19 patients. Our target sample included all the frontline health care professionals (doctors and nurses) who provided
care to infected patients.
We obtained ethics approval for this study from the SubCommittee on Research Ethics and Safety of the Research Committee
of the ﬁrst author’s University (IRB approval code: EC082/1920,
study title: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Doctors and
Nurses). We worked with hospital administrators to collect data in
such a way as to protect conﬁdentiality and anonymity, matching
participants and supervisors using codes to ensure that the participants’ identity was not disclosed to the research team and that the
survey data were not accessible to the hospital management.
Instructions included a consent form notifying respondents that
completing the survey was voluntary and that we would keep their

responses strictly conﬁdential and only use these data for research
purposes.
We employed a three-wave, multisource research design to minimize concerns of common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2012). Data
collection commenced in April 2020 to fully capture the experiences
of the participants during the ﬁrst wave of the crisis. Instructions
asked the health care professionals to report their experiences at work
since the beginning of the pandemic. In wave one, the health care
professionals provided demographic information and completed
measures of the independent variables and moderators. Mediators
were reported 2 weeks later in wave two by the health care professionals. About 3 weeks later, we collected wave three data, including
the well-being outcomes reported by the health care professionals and
leader-rated withdrawal behaviors. The hospital’s administration
department awarded performance bonuses in various amounts to
the health care professionals which reﬂected their job performance
during the pandemic period. We obtained archival data for all the ﬁrstwave participants’ level of ﬁnal performance bonus from the administration department after the survey data collection.
We approached all the 782 health care professionals who worked
in the hospital. Of these, 408 (52.17%) agreed to participate and
responded to our ﬁrst online survey, and we obtained the performance data at the end of the study based on this sample of 408
participants. Among those, 362 participated in the second wave and
315 in the third wave. There were no signiﬁcant demographic
differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Because
Mplus can use full information maximum likelihood to estimate
models in which some variables have missing values (Enders &
Bandalos, 2001), it reported sample size based on the largest number
of sample size that an estimated relationship in the model has
(i.e., 408 in our study). To demonstrate our appreciation, each
participant was given an online cash coupon of RMB 75 (about
9 USD) for their participation. Among the 408 participants, 200
were doctors and the rest were nurses. Further, 32.60% of the
participants were male and 87.75% had a bachelor’s degree or
above. The average age was 34.60 years (SD = 7.63) and the
average organizational tenure was 11.52 years (SD = 7.90).

Measures
We conducted all surveys in Chinese. Following the translationback-translation procedure (Brislin, 1980), three bilingual researchers translated scales originally in English. One researcher ﬁrst
translated the survey to Chinese, and a second researcher doublechecked the Chinese translation and resolved concerns with the ﬁrst
translator. A third researcher then back-translated the resulting
Chinese survey. Appendix A presents all items and provides additional descriptive information.

Proactive Personality
Proactive personality was measured with a ten-item version
(Seibert et al., 1999) of Bateman and Crant’s (1993) original scale.
Cronbach’s alpha was .91.

Analytical Strategies
Our data have a nested structure where the health care professionals
were under the supervision of 52 leaders. To account for potential
nonindependence in the data because there were participants reporting
to the same leader, we employed a sandwich estimator using the
complex modeling with Mplus 8.0. This method can provide an
unbiased and robust estimation of the standard errors, and mitigates
the potential for both Type I and Type II errors associated with nested
data (Bliese & Hanges, 2004; Muthén & Muthén, 2017). For the

COVID-19 hospitals in China used to examine the factor structure of
the two new scales. The second was 270 MTurk respondents from the
health care industry providing data to obtain convergent and discriminant validity evidence for the new scales, and also to differentiate
perceived strengths use with conceptually similar constructs such as
work methods autonomy (Morgeson & Humphry, 2006). Results
from the two independent new samples supported the construct
validity of our study variables (Appendix B).
Hypothesis 1 (H1) predicted a positive relationship between
proactive personality and perceived strengths use. According to the
results of path analysis in Table 3, proactive personality was
positively associated with perceived strengths use (β = .32,
p < .01), supporting H1. Hypotheses 2a (H2a) and 2b (H2b)
predicted a mediated relationship from proactive personality to
performance and withdrawal behaviors through strengths use.
Results in Table 3 show that perceived strengths use was positively related to performance bonus (β = .13, p < .05) but not
related to withdrawal behaviors (β = .00, p = .99). Further, results
in Table 5 show that the indirect effects from proactive personality
through perceived strengths use to performance bonus (indirect
effect estimate = .04, 95% CI = [.01, .08], excluding zero) was

calculation of indirect effects, we used 20,000 resamples of Monte
Carlo simulation and constructed 95% conﬁdence intervals (Preacher
et al., 2010). All the predictors and moderators were grandmean-centered to facilitate interpretation (Aiken et al., 1991). All
analyses were run both with and without the control variables, with
no meaningful differences in results.

Results
Table 1 summarizes the descriptive information of the studied
variables and their bivariate correlations. Prior to hypothesis testing,
we assessed the convergent and discriminant validity of our study
variables by conducting a series of factor analyses. We ﬁrst used the
complex modeling to account for the potential nonindependence of
the data (Muthén & Muthén, 2017). The data showed a good ﬁt with
the hypothesized nine-factor model (Model 1) [χ2(343) = 595.89,
CFI = .96, TLI = .96, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .05], which was
signiﬁcantly better than other alternative models (see Table 2). To
examine the construct validity of the new scales of routine disruption
and physical exposure, we collected two additional samples. The ﬁrst
was a new, independent sample of 181 doctors and nurses from other

signiﬁcant. However, concerning withdrawal behaviors, the indirect effect through perceived strengths use was not signiﬁcant
(indirect effect estimate = .00, 95% CI = [−.05, .05], including
zero). Therefore, H2a but not H2b was supported in that perceived
strengths use mediated the relationship between proactive personality and performance bonus.
Hypotheses 3a (H3a) and 3b (H3b) predicted that perceived
strengths use mediates the relationships between proactive personality and the well-being outcomes. Results in Table 3 show

three-way interaction term was signiﬁcant in the predicted direction
(β = .15, p < .05)1. Figure 2 plots the interaction effects, and
Table 6 presents the slope differences. The signiﬁcant difference
between slope (1) and (2) show that when routine disruption
was high, proactive personality has signiﬁcantly stronger relationships with perceived strengths use when perceived organizational
support was also high rather than low. The slope differences
between (2) and (4) further supported the importance of the joint
effects of both routine disruption and perceived organizational
support in that when routine disruption was high but perceived
organizational support was low, the relationship between proactive
personality and perceived strengths use was even lower than when
both of the moderators were at low levels. Therefore, H4 was
supported (Figure 1b).
Hypotheses 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d considered moderation effects of
physical exposure. Table 4 shows that physical exposure signiﬁcantly moderated the relationship between perceived strengths use
and performance (β = .12, p < .05); the relationship was stronger
when physical exposure was higher. However, other moderation
effects were not found; therefore, H5 was partially supported.
Figure 3 presents a plot of the interaction effects with simple slopes
(Figure 1b).

Discussion
Proactive personality is associated with numerous positive outcomes at work (Crant et al., 2017). This research extends thinking in
this area by showing the importance of proactive personality in
frontline health care professionals’ success in combating the uncertain crisis created by COVID-19. Those high on proactive personality had higher perceived strengths use, which in turn mediated
the relationships between proactive personality and performance,
as well as two indicators of well-being. A three-way interaction

between proactive personality and two contextual moderators,
routine disruption and perceived organizational support, was associated with perceived strengths use. Another contextual moderator,
physical exposure to the virus, affected the relationship between
perceived strengths use and job performance. The nature of the
moderation effect was that physical exposure exacerbated the effects
of perceived strengths use on performance. The results taken as a
whole indicate that a proactive disposition is an important mechanism for both professional and personal success in dealing with the
pandemic.
Our study provides a more in-depth understanding of proactive
personality by considering its value in times of uncertainty and crisis.
Seeing and utilizing opportunities for self-conceived initiatives from
the chaos accompanying crisis by working in more self-concordant
ways and utilizing one’s strengths may provide a fundamental
explanation for how proactives differentiate themselves from others
in difﬁcult times. Their self-directed and future-oriented nature makes
proactives less dependent on other-directed initiatives. In times when
uncertainty is becoming normal rather than exceptional, such as
during the current pandemic, a proactive personality may be more
important than ever before. It provides advantages in terms of
ﬁnding new and better ways of working in crises.
Our study also contributes to the COR theory in important ways.
By conceptualizing proactive personality as a dispositional resource
that contributes to important professional and personal goals in the
context of health care professionals combating COVID-19, our
study delineates how more of this dispositional resource (i.e., higher
proactive personality) facilitates better acquisition and conservation

of other resources (i.e., a job-related motivational resource—perceived strengths use). This provides supportive evidence for the
important corollary of COR that resources can help acquire and
maintain other resources (Hobfoll, 1989; Hobfoll et al., 2018).

Moreover, our ﬁnding for the important role of the mediational
resource of perceived strengths use provides important directions of
interventions for organizations to consider in dealing with the
COVID-19 crisis.

Note. We calculated the Monte Carlo 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) with 20,000 replications.

In addition, our study contributes to research on the management
of crisis and uncertainty. Research on organizational crisis management tends to emphasize the importance of structural measures and
leadership (Bundy et al., 2017). By revealing the importance of
personal agency in maintaining professional and personal success,
our research suggests that individual employees also play critical
roles in managing crisis and uncertainty, thus maintaining effective
organizational functioning at lower levels

Limitations, Future Research, and Practical
Implications
As with all research, ours has some limitations that yield implications for future research. Studying doctors and nurses on the
frontlines during this pandemic is a signiﬁcant strength of the
research design, but also a limitation. Future research may extend
our ﬁndings to other types of health care workers who might also
need to directly confront the uncertainty brought by the COVID-19
situation. Future research might explore these relationships in other
crisis settings. Our research sought to investigate the role of proactive personality in this process, but other individual differences also
likely play a role. Future research might consider examining other
variables that relate to strengths use, such as self-efﬁcacy and core
self-evaluations.
The pandemic has revealed the importance of sound leadership
during the COVID-19 crisis (Sergent & Stajkovic, 2020). Accordingly, this research has several important practical implications.
Given our ﬁndings of the importance of proactivity in the COVID19 context, leaders should promote or enhance employees’ awareness of their personal agency as an important path in dealing with the
crisis, especially considering routine disruption and physical exposure. Hospital management should emphasize that frontline health
care professionals can craft their positions in a way that ﬁts with their
strengths while being consistent with legal parameters. Also helpful

would be efforts to increase the health care professionals’ awareness
and use of their personal strengths. Managers can emphasize
proactivity as a means of dealing with novel and difﬁcult situations.
Moreover, our ﬁnding that perceived organizational support critically enhanced the effect of proactive personality on perceived
strengths use under high routine disruption situations provides
important practical implications for organizations, showing that
even when proactives ﬁnd new ways to do their work during a
crisis, organizational support can still play a signiﬁcant role by
backing them up.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that a proactive orientation is positively associated with a motivational resource, perceived strengths
use. Proactive personality is also indirectly associated with performance and two indicators of well-being, resilience, and thriving, through perceived strengths use. Several COVID-19-related
variables moderated these relationships. The ﬁndings converge on
the importance of a proactive orientation in frontline health care
workers’ professional and personal success in dealing with the
uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Extending
beyond the COVID-19 crisis, the active nature of proactive
personality allows those facing uncertainty and adversity to collect
a valuable job-related motivational resource, which, in turn, yields
greater job performance and well-being. Our longitudinal data
added to the evolving strengths use in organizations literature by
presenting a process by which proactive personality creates greater
strengths use, leading to better performance and well-being.

My organization values my contribution to its well-being.
My organization strongly considers my goals and values.
My organization really cares about my well-being.
My organization is willing to help me when I need a special favor.

Performance Bonus Archival Data
Because of conﬁdentiality considerations, the hospital disclosed
six categories (ranges) of the performance bonus rather than the
amounts each participant’s bonus. We treated the variable as
continuous in our analyses because the categories reﬂected the
level of their performance from low (category 1) to high (category
6), and the ranges had no overlap among different categories. The
categories were evenly distributed and gradated in increments of

9-Item Thriving Scale

RMB 5,000 (e.g., category 1: The employee’s bonus was RMB 0–
4,999; category 2: RMB 5,000–9,999; category 3: RMB 10,000–
14,999, etc.). Because a number of doctors and nurses with other
specialties were recruited to work together against this respiratory
disease, the special bonus was mainly designed to reﬂect these
health care professionals’ efforts and devotion rather than their
original specialties or positions, making the level of performance
bonus comparable among the participants as a reﬂection of their
engagement and behavioral performance.

In my work until now since the pandemic outbreak, : : :
I ﬁnd myself learning often.
I continued to learn more and more as time went by.
I see myself continually improving.
I am not learning. (R)

Note B2. Besides the factor analyses of the study variables, we also recruited two independent new samples to conduct a series of analyses to establish the
discriminant and convergent validity of our study variables, especially the new scales of routine disruption, physical exposure and the adapted measure of
perceived strengths use. First, we examined the discriminant validity of routine disruption and physical exposure by recruiting a new sample of 181 doctors and
nurses from other COVID-19 hospitals in Beijing and Wuhan, because these variables were speciﬁc to the COVID-19 battling context. The two-factor model
provides a better ﬁt to the data compared to a one-factor model as is shown above (Table B1). Secondly, we collected another new sample consists of 270 MTurk
respondents from the health care industry; we collected data from this sample to assess the discriminant and convergent validity of our new scales. Routine
disruption had higher correlations with a convergent variable, event disruption (r = .36, p < .01) than with divergent variables of work-schedule autonomy
(r = .09, n.s.) and work methods autonomy (r = .19, p < .01). Physical exposure to the virus also had higher correlations with a convergent variable, job safety
(r = .50, p < .01) than with divergent variables decision making autonomy (r = .00, n.s.) and work schedule autonomy (r = −.03, n.s.). We further conducted
a CFA between perceived strengths use and work methods autonomy (Table B1), which showed that compared with a one-factor solution where all the items
from both variables were loaded together, the two-factor solution provided a better ﬁt to the data.
