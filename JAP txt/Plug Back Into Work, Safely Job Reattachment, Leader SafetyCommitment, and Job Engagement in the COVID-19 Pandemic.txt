With many employees returning to work after lockdowns and quarantines in the current COVID-19
pandemic, research that seeks to identify effective ways to help them regain focus at work is warranted.
However, the small body of applied psychology literature on large-scale disruptive events has paid
insufficient attention to this important topic. Further, different from acute events (e.g., disasters), the
ongoing pandemic poses an additional challenge for organizations as they seek to effectively protect
employees’ job engagement from health and safety threats in the workplace. To address these gaps, we
drew from job reattachment research and investigated it as an important antecedent of job engagement
for employees returning to work. Moreover, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a moderator
that can strengthen the effectiveness of job reattachment in enhancing job engagement. We further linked
engagement to work withdrawal, use of personal protective equipment (e.g., wearing a mask), and task
performance to underscore the downstream implications of job reattachment. To test our research model,
we collected multiwave, multisource data from the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic—
Wuhan, China—where many employees were returning to work. The results provide strong support for
our model. In addition to extending research on large-scale disruptive events, the current study has
important implications for organizations and employees in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Keywords: COVID-19, job reattachment, engagement, leader safety commitment, safety

environment (North et al., 2010). Therefore, research aimed at
identifying effective activities that can prepare employees for
return to work and “reboot” their job engagement is warranted.
Second, different from acute large-scale disasters, the current
pandemic will likely last for some time, and the chances of
community transmission in the workplace are nonnegligible. This
suggests that the effect of engagement-enhancing activities may be
limited unless organizations can find effective ways to mitigate
workplace health and safety threats.
Importantly, these two practical challenges point to some critical
gaps in the applied psychology literature that warrant scholarly
attention. First, the small body of applied psychology research that
has examined large-scale disruptive and traumatic events has primarily focused on understanding employees’ strain reactions
(Bacharach & Bamberger, 2007; Bacharach et al., 2008; Byron &
Peterson, 2002; Hochwarter et al., 2008; Ryan et al., 2003; Toker
et al., 2015; Vinokur et al., 2011). Although these studies contributed important insights into how these disruptive events affect
employees, they fall short of revealing what employees can do to
regain focus at work after they return. In that regard, researchers
investigating daily nonwork-to-work transitions have introduced
the critical notion of job reattachment, defined as “the process of
mentally reconnecting to one’s work after a nonwork period”
(Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016, p. 380). Examples of job reattachment include mental preparations for and anticipatory deliberation
of upcoming work tasks. Notably, job reattachment shows great
promise as a means to help employees readjust to work after
lockdowns and quarantines as it has been consistently related to

As some countries and regions have substantially “flattened the
curve” and slowed down the spread of COVID-19, lockdowns and
quarantine orders are being lifted and business operations are
slowly resuming. Whether employees were completely out of work
or teleworking to some capacity during the lockdowns, returning to
work in the “new normal”—that is, against the backdrop of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic— creates at least two challenges.
First, after an extended period of disruption, turmoil, and distress,
which many individuals experienced during the pandemic, employees may have difficulty staying focused and engaged after
they return to work, which can influence their work behaviors on
the job (e.g., task performance). For example, accounts abound of
workers who have had trouble readjusting to a postdisaster work

JOB REATTACHMENT IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

greater levels of job engagement (Sonnentag et al., 2020; Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016). In this study, we drew from this emergent
line of research and extended it to the context of employees
returning to work in the current pandemic. In so doing, we sought
to fill the research gap regarding what employees can do to
facilitate their successful return to work by identifying job reattachment as an important driver of job engagement.
Second, due to its prolonged and ongoing nature, the COVID-19
pandemic has exposed another gap in the extant applied psychology research on large-scale disruptive events. Research is needed
to identify the critical contingencies that can protect the effectiveness of engagement-enhancing activities from persistent health and
safety risks and threats in the workplace. Toward that end, safety
climate research has consistently supported the central role of
leaders as a key driver of workplace safety (Beus et al., 2019;
Zohar, 1980, 2014). Specifically, leader safety commitment reinforces the importance of maintaining and promoting workplace
safety to employees through the leader’s own actions (Zohar,
2002).1 In turn, this factor may help mitigate employees’ safety
concerns and unlock the engagement-enhancing potential of job
reattachment. Thus, we incorporate leader safety commitment as a
critical workplace contingency against the backdrop of ongoing
health and safety risks and threats.
Taken together, the current research aimed to investigate job
reattachment as an antecedent of job engagement and thereby shed
light on how employees can regain focus at work as they return
from lockdowns and quarantines. To highlight the downstream,
bottom-line implications of job reattachment in the context of
returning to work, we linked job engagement to three important
work behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic: work withdrawal, use
of personal protective equipment (PPE) at work, and task performance. Moreover, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a
critical moderator that can mitigate ongoing safety and health
concerns in the workplace and protect the engagement-enhancing
effect of job reattachment. To formulate the study hypotheses
regarding the antecedent, the moderator, and consequences of job
engagement, we drew from Kahn’s (1990) seminal work on job
engagement as the overarching theoretical framework. Figure 1
summarizes our research model.

Job Reattachment and Job Engagement
Job engagement refers to employees’ harnessing of their physical, cognitive, and emotional energies toward executing their
work roles (Kahn, 1990). Given the importance of energies and
resources in enabling job engagement, Kahn’s seminal work emphasizes availability as a critical psychological condition conducive to engagement. To date, a large number of studies have
investigated antecedents of job engagement (Bakker et al., 2014;
Crawford et al., 2010; Rich et al., 2010), with the vast majority
focusing on either external job characteristics or psychological
traits that can increase employees’ repertoire of resources (Sonnentag et al., 2020). However, in the case of returning to the
workplace, it becomes especially important to understand which
actions employees can take as a means of reigniting their postreturn job engagement.
In their work, Sonnentag and Kühnel (2016) drew upon role
transitions in the daily context (Ashforth et al., 2000) and investigated job reattachment as an antecedent of engagement. Central

63

to the idea of job reattachment is the notion that as employees
physically transition back to the workplace, they need to mentally
reconnect with their upcoming work. Throughout such anticipatory
efforts, job reattachment “mobilizes one’s energy, directs one’s
attention back toward work and allocates resources” (Sonnentag &
Kühnel, 2016, p. 381), which ultimately enhances the availability
of psychological resources and promotes job engagement. In research supporting its important role, job reattachment before the
start of the workday was associated with higher levels of job
engagement during the day across two daily studies (Sonnentag et
al., 2020; Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016). As employees returning to
work in trying times may have difficulty readjusting to the work
environment (North et al., 2010), mental reconnection with one’s
work becomes even more important. Extending the emergent line
of job reattachment research to the context of employees returning
to work after lockdowns and quarantines, we expected job reattachment to be positively related to job engagement.
Hypothesis 1: Job reattachment is positively related to job
engagement.

Moderating Role of Leader Safety Commitment
In addition to availability, Kahn’s (1990) model posits that
employees need to feel psychologically safe before they can invest
their full selves into work. In other words, when employees feel
psychologically threatened, resource availability will have a very
limited effect in elevating job engagement. Notably, Kahn’s seminal work was based on interviews with summer camp counselors
and employees at an architecture firm (e.g., architects and designers), for whom psychological safety—rather than physical safety—
was a primary concern. Although psychological safety is undeniably important, in workplaces where employees’ physical health
and safety are threatened—as in the current COVID-19 pandemic—it is reasonable to expect physical health and safety to be a
salient factor that can thwart the effects of resource availability in
fostering job engagement. As such, work factors that can mitigate
these health and safety threats and create perceptions of a workplace that is supportive of health and safety will prove valuable in
helping employees mobilize their resources toward the execution
of their work roles.2
Toward that end, a large volume of safety research has consistently shown that leaders play a pivotal role in reinforcing the
importance of safe work practices, maintaining workplace safety,
and creating perceptions that workplaces are supportive of employees’ safety through their own commitment to safety (Barling
et al., 2002; Hofmann & Stetzer, 1996; Zohar, 2002). Among the
various work factors that are conducive to supportive safety climate perceptions, it has been noted that “the core meaning of
safety climate concerns [the] perceived management commitment
to employee protection” (Zohar, 2014, p. 328). Given that many
openly stated safety and health policies and practices may not be
fully enforced in the workplace (Halbesleben, 2010b), perceived
1
In the current study, we define leader safety commitment as an individual employee’s perceptions of the leader’s commitment to workplace
safety (i.e., at the individual level; Beus et al., 2019).

Given our focus on physical health and safety, we use the generic term
“safety” to refer to employees’ physical—not psychological—safety
throughout the article.

leader safety commitment, which captures the enacted managerial
safety practices, is most effective in reassuring employees of the
importance of health and safety issues in the workplace (Zohar,
1980, 2014). In a similar vein, Kahn’s (1990) model of job
engagement emphasizes the critical role of leaders in setting the
“tone” for safety, although it primarily focuses on psychological
safety.
In our model, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a
moderator in the relationship between job reattachment and job
engagement. To the extent that leader safety commitment can help
mitigate health and safety threats in the workplace (Nahrgang et
al., 2011; Ye et al., 2020), we posited that it will reassure employees of the importance of their health and safety in the workplace
and therefore unlock the engagement-enhancing potential of job
reattachment. When their leader is strongly committed to maintaining workplace safety, employees who are mentally prepared
for work by job reattachment will be able to channel their energy
into their work roles upon returning to work. However, when
employees perceive their leader as not committed to promoting
safety, their cognitive preparations to reconnect with work may
prove futile as they will not feel physically safe to invest their
resources into their work tasks.
Hypothesis 2: Leader safety commitment moderates the positive relationship between job reattachment and job engagement such that this relationship is stronger when leader safety
commitment is higher versus lower.

Outcomes of Job Engagement
As employees bring their full selves to their work roles, job
engagement can further influence a wide range of employee work
behaviors (Kahn, 1990; Rich et al., 2010). Meta-analytic evidence
has consistently linked engagement to a host of positive work
behaviors (Christian et al., 2011; Halbesleben, 2010a; Nahrgang et
al., 2011). In the current study, we extended the positive consequences of job engagement to the context of returning to work and
highlighted its important implications in the current pandemic. As
employees exert their cognitive, emotional, and physical energies
at work, we expected that highly engaged employees will demonstrate greater levels of task performance. Moreover, given that
large-scale disruptive and traumatic events may give rise to undesirable work behaviors (Byron & Peterson, 2002), we linked
engagement to lower levels of work withdrawal to highlight its
importance in the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, as safety performance is predicated on the mobilization of motivational resources
toward compliance with safety protocols (Griffin & Neal, 2000),

highly engaged employees are more likely to comply with safety
procedures (Nahrgang et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2015). We thus
linked job engagement to using PPE (e.g., wearing a face mask) at
work—a critical component of safety performance that is broadly
relevant for virtually every job in the current COVID-19 pandemic
(Burke et al., 2002).
Incorporating Hypothesis 1, which focused on the effect of job
reattachment on job engagement, we expected that job reattachment would be indirectly related to work withdrawal, use of PPE,
and task performance through job engagement. Moreover, taking
into account the moderating role of leader safety commitment in
the relationship between job reattachment and job engagement, we
hypothesized that these indirect effects would be stronger with
higher levels of leader safety commitment.3
Hypothesis 3: Job reattachment is indirectly related to lower
levels of withdrawal (3a), higher levels of PPE use (3b), and
higher levels of task performance (3c) via job engagement.
Hypothesis 4: The indirect effects of job reattachment on work
withdrawal (4a), use of PPE (4b), and task performance (4c)
via job engagement are stronger when leader safety commitment is higher versus lower.

Method
Participants and Procedure
We recruited study participants from Wuhan, China—at the
time, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.4 On April 8, 2020,
the city ended its 76-day lockdown, after which normal business
operations slowly resumed (Culver & Westcott, 2020). Employees
who had stopped working during the lockdown and then returned
to their jobs were invited to participate in the current study by
completing three surveys, which were temporally spaced 2 weeks
3
In line with Kahn’s (1990) work, which posits that availability and
safety are necessary conditions for engagement, we theorized leader safety
commitment as a moderator in the relationship between job reattachment
and job engagement (i.e., a first-stage moderator). In response to a reviewer’s suggestion, we tested an alternative model that incorporated the
moderating role of leader safety commitment in the direct relationships
between job reattachment and the three outcomes but found only limited
support for this model. Complete results are available upon request.

JOB REATTACHMENT IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

apart. Several recruitment methods were used to achieve the desired sample size.5 Specifically, we circulated the study information among Master of Business Administration alumni of a large
university in central China; we also contacted companies located
in the university’s science park, asking them to invite their employees to participate in this study. In addition, we reached out to
our professional contacts and handed out study flyers in communities to solicit additional participants. Participants received 10
Chinese Yuan (approximately $1.45) for completing each survey.
The Time 1 survey was administered around the beginning of May,
approximately 3 weeks after the lockdown was lifted; it measured
job reattachment, along with covariates and demographics. The
Time 2 survey assessed leader safety commitment. At Time 3,
participants reported job engagement, work withdrawal, and use of
PPE at work. We also invited supervisors to provide task performance ratings at Time 3.
Among the 485 participants who consented to participate, we
obtained complete data from 395 supervisor-employee dyads (retention rate ⫽ 81.4%). Although most of these dyads (n ⫽ 331)
were independent, 64 were not (i.e., 64 employees nested within
21 supervisors). Following a reviewer’s suggestion, we randomly
selected one employee from those working with the same supervisor. The final study sample thus consisted of 352 independent
supervisor-employee dyads. Employees in the final sample held
various types of jobs (e.g., office administration, sales, accounting,
technician) from a wide range of industries (e.g., information
technology, manufacturing, real estate). The majority of the participants were female (60.5%) and married (64.5%). Their average
age was 33.28 years (SD ⫽ 7.30). On average, they worked 43.87
hr per week (SD ⫽ 10.11) and had been employed for 10.22 years
(SD ⫽ 7.72).

Measures
All study measures were administered in Chinese. The first
author translated the items into Chinese, after which the third
author back-translated the items into English, following Brislin’s
(1970) procedure. The three authors reviewed the original and
back-translated items. At the identification of meaningful discrepancies across the two versions, the translated items were revised to
ensure conceptual equivalence. A 5-point scale was used (1 ⫽
strongly disagree to 5 ⫽ strongly agree), unless otherwise noted.

Job Reattachment (Time 1)
We used the five-item scale developed by Sonnentag and Kühnel (2016) to assess job reattachment (␣ ⫽ .77). As this scale was
originally developed to capture daily reattachment (i.e., before the
start of the workday), we revised the time referent to reflect
activities undertaken in preparation for the postlockdown return to
work. Employees were asked to recall what they did before returning to work and to indicate their agreement with each item
(e.g., “I prepared mentally for my work”; “I thought about what I
would encounter at my work”).

Leader Safety Commitment (Time 2)
We used the six-item scale from Beus et al. (2019) to measure
leader safety commitment (␣ ⫽ .87). Participants were asked to
think about workplace safety issues in relation to COVID-19 (e.g.,
mask wearing, temperature monitoring) and to indicate their agree-

65

ment with each statement based on their leader’s behaviors in the
past 2 weeks (e.g., “My supervisor took a proactive stance when it
comes to safety”).

Job Engagement (Time 3)
In alignment with Kahn’s (1990) conceptualization, we used the
nine-item scale developed by Crawford et al. (2013) to measure
job engagement (␣ ⫽ .90). Participants were instructed to think
about how they felt at work during the past 2 weeks and to indicate
their agreement with each item (e.g., “I devoted a lot of my energy
at work”).

Work Withdrawal (Time 3)
We used the eight-item scale by Lehman and Simpson (1992) to
assess work withdrawal (␣ ⫽ .83). Given that supervisors may be
unable to observe undesirable behaviors (Berry et al., 2012), we
asked participants to self-report their work withdrawal in the past
2 weeks (e.g., “I left my workstation for unnecessary reasons”; “I
put less effort into job than I should have”).

Use of PPE (Time 3)
We used a four-item scale (originally from Burke et al., 2002;
shortened by Ford & Tetrick, 2011) to measure PPE use at work as
a form of safety-compliance behavior (␣ ⫽ .74). Similar to work
withdrawal, we asked participants to self-report their use of PPE at
work during the past 2 weeks (e.g., “I used the appropriate PPE
[e.g., masks] as indicated by the site health and safety plan”).

Task Performance (Time 3)
Supervisors were asked to rate their employees’ task performance (␣ ⫽ .76) during the past 2 weeks with the four-item scale
developed by Van Dyne and LePine (1998). A sample item is
“[This subordinate] met performance expectations.”

Covariates
We included four covariates in the Time 1 survey that could
potentially act as third variables. As employees working more
hours might mentally prepare for and stay engaged at work to a
greater extent, we incorporated weekly work hours, reported by
participants, as a covariate. We also noted that the engagementenhancing effect of job reattachment might be a byproduct of some
employees feeling less vulnerable to the risk of COVID-19 and
thus more mentally prepared for returning to work. Therefore, we
assessed perceptions associated with COVID-19 by using two
single-item measures from research on the 2003 severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak (Leung et al., 2003). Specifically, participants reported their likelihood of (a) contracting
COVID-19 during the current outbreak and (b) surviving
COVID-19 if infected. Responses were made on a 5-point scale
(1 ⫽ extremely unlikely to 5 ⫽ extremely likely). Following a
reviewer’s suggestion, we also incorporated age as a covariate as
5
A priori analysis based on .90 power and a correlation of .20 (Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016) indicated the minimum sample size was 211 (Faul
et al., 2007). However, to guard against (a) participant attrition in timelagged surveys, (b) incomplete survey responses involving both employee
and supervisor reports, and (c) insufficient power to detect moderation
(Aguinis et al., 2005), we sought to recruit a larger sample.

older employees may be more vulnerable to health complications

Results
Descriptive statistics and correlations among all study variables
are reported in Table 1. Prior to hypothesis testing, we conducted
a set of confirmatory factor analyses to examine the factor structure of the study variables. We first fit to the data a six-factor
model in which items loaded onto their respective latent variables,
which provided a reasonably good fit: ␹2(579) ⫽ 950.09, comparative fit index (CFI) ⫽ .92, standardized root-mean-square residual
(SRMR) ⫽ .055, and root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) ⫽ .043. Further, following a reviewer’s suggestion, we
tested an alternative model where items for reattachment and
engagement loaded onto the same latent factor. This five-factor
model provided a significantly worse fit than the six-factor model:
␹2(584) ⫽ 1320.83, CFI ⫽ .84, SRMR ⫽ .078, RMSEA ⫽ .060;
⌬␹2(5) ⫽ 370.74, p ⬍ .01.
Next, we ran a set of hierarchical regression analyses to test our
hypotheses. Prior to hypothesis testing, we grand-mean centered
job reattachment and leader safety commitment to reduce nonessential multicollinearity and facilitate the interpretation of the
moderating effects (Cohen et al., 2003; Dalal & Zickar, 2012). To
examine the conditional indirect effects, we used PROCESS
(Hayes, 2013) and constructed 95% bias-corrected confidence
intervals (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) using 5,000 bootstrap samples.
Table 2 reports the results from the hierarchical regression
analyses. In all analyses, covariates were entered along with main
study variables, though we note the inclusion of covariates did not
result in any meaningful differences that would alter the hypothesis testing results. As shown in Model 1a, job reattachment was
positively related to job engagement (b ⫽ .37, t ⫽ 6.03, p ⬍ .01),
thereby supporting Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 was tested in
Model 1c. The interaction between job reattachment and leader
safety commitment was significant (b ⫽ .17, t ⫽ 2.65, p ⬍ .01).
Simple slope tests indicated that when leader safety commitment
was lower (⫺1 SD), the effect of job reattachment was weaker

(b ⫽ .18, t ⫽ 2.67, p ⬍ .01), whereas it became stronger (b ⫽ .41,
t ⫽ 4.62, p ⬍ .01) with higher levels of leader safety commitment
(⫹1 SD). The interaction is plotted in Figure 2. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 received empirical support.
After controlling for job reattachment, job engagement was
related to work withdrawal (Model 2a: b ⫽ ⫺.25, t ⫽ 4.91, p ⬍
.01), PPE use (Model 2b: b ⫽ .15, t ⫽ 3.54, p ⬍ .01), and task
performance (Model 2c: b ⫽ .14, t ⫽ 3.54, p ⬍ .01) in the
expected directions. Moreover, the 95% confidence intervals of the
indirect effects of job reattachment on these work outcomes via job
engagement did not include zero (work withdrawal: estimate ⫽ ⫺.092, 95% CI [⫺.154, ⫺.048]; PPE use: estimate ⫽
.058, [.023, .111]; task performance: estimate ⫽ .051, [.023,
.093]). Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was supported.
To test Hypothesis 4, we calculated the conditional indirect
effects at ⫾1 SD of leader safety commitment. With higher levels
of leader safety commitment, the indirect effects of job reattachment on work withdrawal (estimate ⫽ ⫺.102, 95% CI
[⫺.200, ⫺.043]), PPE use (estimate ⫽ .064, [.022, .136]), and task
performance (estimate ⫽ .056, [.022, .115]) were stronger. When
leader safety commitment was lower, these indirect effects became
weaker (work withdrawal: estimate ⫽ ⫺.045, [⫺.104, .001]; PPE
use: estimate ⫽ .028, [.001, .071]; task performance: estimate ⫽
.025, [.001, .066]). Therefore, Hypothesis 4 received support.

Discussion
We undertook this study to better understand what employees
can do to facilitate their return to work and how leaders can protect
the engagement-enhancing effects of such activities in the
COVID-19 pandemic. Results from a sample of employees residing in the then-epicenter of the pandemic provided strong support
for our research model. Specifically, job reattachment in preparation for returning to work was related to greater levels of job
engagement, which was associated with lower levels of work
withdrawal and higher levels of PPE use and task performance.
Moreover, the relationship between job reattachment and job engagement was stronger with higher levels of leader safety com-

mitment. Our findings have important implications for applied
psychology research and practices in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Theoretical and Practical Implications
First, this research contributes to the small body of literature on
the implications of large-scale disruptive and traumatic events for
workplaces by identifying job reattachment as an important driver
of job engagement. Extending research focused on daily nonworkto-work transitions (Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016), our findings
suggest job reattachment warrants attention from researchers and
practitioners as a fruitful way to “reboot” employee engagement
amid transitions back to work in trying times such as the
COVID-19 pandemic. Although the extant job reattachment research is focused on the daily nonwork-to-work context, our findings indicate that it may be a promising strategy to recalibrate
engagement during various types of work transitions (e.g., return
to work after injuries, Hepburn et al., 2010; bridge employment,
Wang et al., 2008).
Consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of the job reattachment concept (Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016), our findings underscore the practical importance of employees rebuilding their
cognitive connections to their work. In other words, when employees physically return to work, they also need to be mentally
prepared to dive into their upcoming work. Given the disruptions
and turmoil that many employees may have experienced during

lockdowns and quarantines, these efforts to rebuild mental connections with work can go a long way in helping them regain focus
at work. Due to the nascent nature of job reattachment research,
systematic guidance regarding reattachment practices and interventions is currently lacking. Nevertheless, in line with the existing literature (Sonnentag et al., 2020; Sonnentag & Kühnel, 2016),
employees are encouraged to set aside some time to mentally
reflect on their work tasks, review their past work progress and the
disruptions that occurred during the lockdown, get organized by
creating a to-do list for work tasks, and set priorities for their
upcoming work goals.
Second, this research highlights the crucial role that leaders play
in helping employees regain focus at work. The current COVID-19
pandemic differs markedly from previous acute large-scale disruptive events due to its prolonged and ongoing nature. Further, it has
expanded the importance of health and safety beyond traditionally
safety-critical industries, extending these concerns to virtually
every workplace. As leaders are the primary organizational agents
to enact and enforce workplace health and safety policies and
practices, their commitment to safety plays a critical role in reassuring employees of the importance of their health and safety in
the workplace (Zohar, 1980, 2014). In support of this notion, our
study found that leader safety commitment strengthened the effectiveness of job reattachment in promoting job engagement. It was
also positively related to job engagement and other important work

to Predict Job Engagement

foster their job engagement. This quest has taken on new urgency
in the pandemic as many employees returning to work from
lockdowns and quarantines may have trouble staying focused at
work. Moreover, to the extent that job engagement is associated
with important work behaviors such as task performance and PPE
use, failure to support employees during such trying times may
create undesirable long-term consequences that may hurt workplace effectiveness and safety. Nevertheless, the positive impact of
job engagement on work outcomes should not be used as an excuse
for organizations to create prescriptive pressure—that is, to insist
employees must be fully engaged at work. The COVID-19 pandemic has created numerous challenges for organizations and their
members (Sinclair et al., 2020). Without effective support from
their employers, demanding that workers be fully engaged with
their jobs will merely add to their distress.

Study Limitations and Future Directions

outcomes. These findings suggest that leader safety commitment in
the current COVID-19 pandemic warrants attention from both
researchers and organizational practitioners.
On this front, our findings underscore the critical role of leader
safety commitment and offer a sobering reminder for organizations
that regardless of their stated health and safety goals, what truly
matters is perceived leader safety commitment in day-to-day managerial practices. Safety climate scholars have long noted that
enacted managerial practices may deviate from the stated organizational emphasis on employee health and safety such that leaders
may fail to “walk the talk” even in safety-critical organizations
(Zohar, 2014). Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed
many potentially problematic organizational practices that may put
employees in harm’s way. For their part, managers are strongly
encouraged to lead by example and actively maintain and promote
workplace health and safety themselves. Given the rapidly changing situation resulting from the highly contagious coronavirus,
managers need to take a proactive approach when setting and
enforcing health and safety standards in the workplace.
Third, our research extends Kahn’s (1990) engagement model
by identifying physical health and safety as a necessary condition
conducive to engagement. Specifically, our findings indicate that
physical safety can be a salient concern that, if left unaddressed,
will thwart the harnessing of the employee’s full self into work
tasks. Additionally, in linking job engagement to lower levels of
work withdrawal and higher levels of PPE use and task performance, this research both extends the positive effects of job
engagement to the context of returning to work and underscores
the importance of fostering employee engagement in trying times
such as the current COVID-19 pandemic as these work behaviors—in aggregate— can protect employees’ health and safety and
contribute to workplace effectiveness.
For organizations, the mediating role of job engagement highlights the need to identify effective ways to support employees and

Despite its strengths, the current study has several limitations
worth noting. First, most of the study variables were assessed with
self-reports, thus raising concerns about common method variance
(Podsakoff et al., 2012). However, we introduced temporal lags
and used supervisor ratings to assess task performance, both of
which could mitigate the potential influence of common method
variance. Second, although we ruled out some potential third
variables, the internal validity of our findings was limited. To
establish causality among study variables, experiments with manipulations and random assignments are warranted, although we
note experimental procedures may create additional disruptions for
employees returning to work. Alternatively, a cross-lagged survey
design could allow for stronger causal inferences.
Third, our findings may have limited generalizability across
jobs, industries, and countries and regions. The role of leader
safety commitment may be even more salient in certain jobs (e.g.,
physicians) and industries (e.g., health care). Moreover, notwithstanding the critical role of leader safety commitment, other contextual factors may influence the effectiveness of job reattachment.
For example, PPE shortages may create additional health and
safety concerns for employees. Further, as China has effectively
prevented a second wave of COVID-19 so far (Rapoza, 2020), the
general risk of contracting COVID-19 remains low in that country.
By comparison, the effectiveness of job reattachment in enhancing
job engagement may be weaker in countries and regions where
employees perceive greater levels of risks associated with COVID19. It is also important to consider employees’ underlying health
conditions (e.g., immunodeficiency) when extrapolating our findings across populations. In addition, the positive link between
engagement and PPE use we discovered in this study may have
limited generalizability. Although there exists strong public consensus regarding the importance of using PPE (e.g., face masks) in
the geographic area where we collected data, this may not be the
case in other countries and regions. Last, we emphasize that our
focus on return to work in this research is not intended to downplay the importance of alternative work arrangements, which
should still be considered superior from the standpoint of health
and safety. Organizations are advised to consult their local public
health department for the most up-to-date guidance regarding
workplace health and safety.

JOB REATTACHMENT IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

In terms of future research, we encourage researchers to build on
the current study and further enrich the theoretical breadth of job
reattachment. The extant research on job reattachment conceptualizes it as a single-dimension construct (Sonnentag & Kühnel,
2016). Given that highly engaged employees harness their full
selves cognitively, emotionally, and physically at work (Kahn,
1990), research that expands its conceptualization by considering
its cognitive, emotional, and physical dimensions holds great
promise to further elevate its engagement-enhancing potential. For
example, researchers can consider incorporating activities that
employees use to prepare themselves cognitively (e.g., mental
preview of work tasks), emotionally (e.g., anticipatory emotion
regulation), and physically (e.g., light to moderate physical activities before work). Moreover, given the salient role of leader safety
commitment in the current study, we encourage scholars to draw
from the safety literature and incorporate safety climate and its key
dimensions into research on large-scale disruptive and traumatic
events that may threaten employees’ health and safety.
