Women’s Leadership Is Associated With Fewer Deaths During the
COVID-19 Crisis: Quantitative and Qualitative Analyses of
United States Governors

The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) spotlights the need for effective leadership
in a crisis. Leadership research in applied psychology suggests that women tend to be preferred over men
as leaders during uncertain times. We contribute to this literature by examining, in the context of
COVID-19, whether states with women governors had fewer deaths than states with men governors, and
why. We tested this research question with publicly available data on COVID-19 deaths in the United
States as of May 5, 2020 and found that states with women governors had fewer COVID-19 deaths
compared to states with men governors. Governor sex also interacted with early stay-at-home orders;
states with women governors who issued these orders early had fewer deaths compared to states with men
governors who did the same. To provide insight into psychological mechanisms of this relationship, we
conducted a qualitative analysis of governor briefings that took place between April 1, 2020 and May 5,
2020 (251 briefings, 38 governors, 1.2 million words). Compared to men, women governors expressed
more empathy and confidence in their briefings. Practical implications are discussed.

Michel, 2018; Post & Byron, 2015). In particular, research comparing women and men on transformational leadership (Bass &
Riggio, 2006) showed that women scored higher on charisma and
individualized consideration (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van
Engen, 2003), giving rise to a “female leadership advantage” under
contemporary conditions (Eagly & Carli, 2003, p. 807). Ryan,
Haslam, and Postmes (2007) similarly found that women tend to
be favored as leaders during a crisis, and they are also selected to
contest hard-to-win elections (Ryan, Haslam, & Kulich, 2010).
Palvia, Vahamaa, and Vahamaa (2015) found “strong evidence
that smaller banks with female CEOs and chairwomen were less
likely to fail” (p. 577) during the 2008 recession. In their review of
studies on women’s leadership during trying times, Ryan et al.
(2016) likewise concluded that women leaders seem to be preferred during business downturns.
This literature prompted our research question: Do states in the
United States with women governors have fewer COVID-19
deaths than states with men governors, and why? To examine this
question, we used publicly available data and compared the number of reported deaths caused by COVID-19 among states in the
United States. Because these data were archival, we examined
gender with the information available, as a dichotomous biological
sex variable. We found statistically significantly fewer deaths in

The COVID-19 pandemic has been described as one of the most
challenging societal crises since World War II. For example, on
April 5, 2020, the Surgeon General of the United States warned the
public, “Next week is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment. It’s
going to be our 9/11 moment.”1 A month later, on May 6, 2020,
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany expressed similar worries: “The President has been clear that at this moment
we’re at a war-time moment where we’re fighting the invisible
enemy. And by that, I mean COVID-19.”2
This crisis has changed people’s lives in unprecedented ways. In
addition to public health concerns, the crisis has left many fearing
for their jobs, struggling with rampant unemployment, and losing
faith in the effectiveness of business and political leaders (Gershman, 2020; Horsley, 2020). Rapid escalation of COVID-19 highlights the need for timely and effective decision-making by leaders. Applied psychology research has shown that perceptions of
who makes an effective leader can be altered in a crisis (Ryan,
Haslam, Hersby, & Bongiorno, 2011).
One perspective from which leadership literature in applied
psychology (Lord, Day, Zaccaro, Avolio, & Eagly, 2017) can be
evaluated is gender effectiveness (Hoobler, Masterson, Nkomo, &

states with women governors than in states with men governors.
To provide insight into potential psychological mechanisms of this
relationship, we conducted a qualitative analysis of governors’
COVID-19-related briefings. In comparison to men governors,
women governors expressed more empathy and exuded greater
confidence.
We proceed as follows. First, we describe the context during
which the data for this article were collected. Next, we review the
applied psychology literature on gender and leadership that guided
our research question and analyses. Then, we report the results of
both quantitative and qualitative analyses. We conclude with a
discussion of practical implications.

Context, Literature Review, and Theory Background
for the Research Question
Context
Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, states are
granted responsibility for safeguarding the welfare, safety, and
health of the public. In emergencies, state governors have the
power to issue executive orders, activate the National Guard, and
request financial and military aid from the federal government.
Because governors have influence over state-level public health
outcomes, we used the COVID-19 crisis to examine if governor
sex influences the COVID-19-related death count, and why. On
April 16, 2020, President Trump called attention to the differences
in leadership among the U.S. governors and their impact on
important outcomes: “They [governors] really worked hard and . . .
some states got too much credit for what they’ve done . . . and
others haven’t been given credit that have done a phenomenal
job.”3
To illustrate, on March 15, 2020, California Governor Gavin
Newsom issued an order closing all public establishments and
institutions across the state. In contrast, on April 14, 2020, South
Dakota Governor Krisi Noem announced that she would not issue
a statewide stay-at-home order: “I’ve been very clear about the fact
that I don’t think decisions for Sioux Falls are the same decisions
that are correct and right for a town like Faith or Lemmon, South
Dakota.”

Literature Review: Theoretical Perspectives on Gender
and Leadership Effectiveness
Gender as a differentiator of leadership effectiveness has
spawned polemic in the past five decades (Megargee, 1969).
Several journals have devoted special issues to gender and leadership effectiveness—for example, The Leadership Quarterly (Eagly & Heilman, 2016), American Psychologist (Chin, 2010), and
Education Sciences (O’Connor, 2018); hence, our review is brief.
Research on gender and leadership effectiveness typically adheres to either a micro or a macro level of analysis. Micro research
studies individual-level variables—for example, leader behaviors—whereas macro research investigates “the shaking and moving” of a firm to face the future, cope with change, and achieve
organizational-level results (Nicholls, 1988, p. 16). The present
study bridges the micro-macro divide by relating a micro predictor
(governors’ sex) to a macro outcome (state death count). This
cross-level research answers a call by Hoobler et al. (2018, p.

2490) for gender and leadership studies that capture “multiple
vantage points and conduct studies that serve to bridge—not
further divide—these two [macro and micro] approaches.”
At a micro level of analysis, research has indicated that women
seem to be sought-out as leaders in times of uncertainty (Ryan et
al., 2011). In comparison to men, arguably, this is because of
women’s desire to help others, capacity to balance risk, and
resilience to “bounce back” from failure more pragmatically (Ryan
et al., 2016). This research often derives its conclusions from
surveys, such as by asking participants to rate characteristics of
managers from successful and unsuccessful companies (Haslam &
Ryan, 2008; Ryan et al., 2011), by evaluating stock-market declines (Ryan & Haslam, 2005), and by probing political appointments by opposing political parties (Ryan et al., 2010). Though
valuable in accentuating gender differences in leadership effectiveness, the characteristics of the “crisis” examined (e.g., decreased firm performance) do not equate to the multifaceted severity of the COVID-19 crisis.
Research on social roles (Eagly, 1987; Eagly & Steffen, 1984)
suggests that the behavior of women and men leaders is guided by
role stereotypes, according to which women tend to be communal
and sharing, whereas men are agentic and independent (ChrobotMason, Hoobler, & Burno, 2019; Eagly & Steffen, 2000; Koenig,
Eagly, Mitchell, & Ristikari, 2011). If women act incongruently
with gender role stereotypes, more often than not, such behavior is
evaluated unfavorably (Eagly, 2004; Eagly & Karau, 2002; Eagly,
Makhijani, & Klonsky, 1992; Rudman & Glick, 2001). This covariation reinforces work behavior in line with gender stereotypes
(Amanatullah & Morris, 2010; Bowles, Babcock, & Lai, 2007;
Brescoll, 2011; Heilman, Block, Martell, & Simon, 1989).
Social– cognitive theory of gender role development and differentiation postulates that gender-driven behavior depends on a
coupling of external and internal influences in any given context
(Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Although much of human learning and
adaptation is socially situated, neither women nor men are passive
objects orchestrated by their environments. Instead, they are sentient agents of their experiences, and self-referent thought is an
intermediary between one’s social milieu and behavior. In this
vein, cognition (e.g., causal attributions, self-efficacy) mediates
the impact of gender on leadership effectiveness (Betz & Hackett,
1981; Brown & Lent, 2016, 2017; Bussey & Bandura, 1999;
Hartman & Betz, 2007; Mazei et al., 2015).
Macrolevel research in this literature has historically focused on
the link between gender and organizational-level effectiveness
(Krishnan & Park, 2005; Nielsen & Huse, 2010) and on examining
moderators (e.g., legal, sociocultural context) of this relationship
(Abdullah, Ismail, & Nachum, 2016; Hoobler et al., 2018; Post &
Byron, 2015). For example, two recent meta-analyses found a
positive relationship between women’s leadership (e.g., number of
women on the board) and firm performance (e.g., accounting
returns; Hoobler et al., 2018; Post & Byron, 2015). Some mediators of the relationship between gender and firm-level effectiveness include women enhancing the firm’s legitimacy in the eyes of
stakeholders (Bilimoria, 2006), offering heterogeneity and depth in

WOMEN’S LEADERSHIP AND FEWER COVID-19 DEATHS

decision-making (Carter, D’Souza, Simkins, & Simpson, 2010),
and impacting evaluations of resource dependence (Hambrick,
2007; Peterson & Philpot, 2007).
Macrolevel gender leadership studies typically use financial
indicators as measures of effectiveness. This assumes that the
primary meter of whether women make effective leaders is their
influence on a firm’s bottom line (Hoobler et al., 2018). For
context, in an analysis of articles in three management journals
between 1972 and 2001, Walsh, Weber, and Margolis (2003)
found that fewer than 2% of studies considered welfare outcomes.
Economic effectiveness is critical, but a sole focus on it leaves
much unsaid about leadership beyond a firm’s monetary bottom
line.

Theory Background for the Research Question
Our crossed micro-macro research mirrors the situation on the
ground: State governors are individuals responsible for state-level
outcomes. As former Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill proclaimed, “All politics is local” (O’Neill, 1994, p. 1); in many ways,
the impact of COVID-19 is local, too, for governors make decisions for their states. We next discuss why whether a governor is
a man or woman may make a difference on COVID-19 deaths in
a state.
First, as mentioned, women tend to be preferred for leadership
positions across professions during times of uncertainty (Adams,
Gupta, & Leeth, 2009; Ashby, Ryan, & Haslam, 2007; Eagly &
Johnson, 1990; Eagly, Karau, & Makhijani, 1995). In general, this
appears to be because qualities that make a leader effective when
circumstances are smooth differ from leadership characteristics
needed in a crisis, and women seem to navigate uncharted waters
better than men (Haslam et al., 2001; Hunt, Boal, & Dodge, 1999;
Pillai & Meindl, 1998; Ryan et al., 2011). For routine operations,
advance plans can be drawn up and executed in a linear and
controlled manner. In contrast, in a crisis, rationality is bounded
(Simon, 1997), and effective leadership requires curvilinear thinking, such as relying more on creativity, improvisation, and intuition (Pearson & Sommer, 2011). Research in both applied and
neuropsychology suggests that women exhibit more of these qualities than men (Byron & Khazanchi, 2012; Byron, Khazanchi, &
Nazarian, 2010; Hausmann & Güntürkün, 1999; Kimura, 1987;
Pagnani, 2011).
Second, leaders face unfamiliar dilemmas during a life-anddeath crisis, making the capacity to foster collaboration and leverage knowledge across teams with multidisciplinary expertise a
critical skill. Doing this effectively requires a willingness to distribute authority and share information. The tendency for women
to have a democratic leadership style (Eagly & Johnson, 1990)
increases the likelihood of information sharing, generating more
diverse ideas, brainstorming, and consensus building, which in
turn increases cooperation and facilitates adaptive decisionmaking (Bartunek, Walsh, & Lacey, 2000; Mano-Negrin & Sheaffer, 2004).
Third, the psychologically tense atmosphere of the COVID-19
crisis makes promoting psychological safety another key to leadership effectiveness. Leaders need to create milieus in which
people discuss ideas, raise questions, and share concerns without
fear of repercussions. Men tend to associate psychological safety
with knowledge and control, while women tend to associate it with

773

health and security (Kharlamenkova, 2015). In taxing situations,
men typically use problem-focused coping (Ptacek, Smith, &
Dodge, 1994; Ptacek, Smith, & Zanas, 1992), whereas women tend
to seek social support using emotion-focused coping (Baker &
Berenbaum, 2007; Tamres, Janicki, & Helgeson, 2002). Though
some situations bode better for problem-focused coping, during a
crisis, followers’ concerns turn toward basic needs, and such
worries are often emotionally laden. Thus, successful leaders show
awareness of their followers’ feelings and acknowledge the emotional challenges faced. Doing this effectively necessitates empathy, defined as an emotional response congruent with the perceived
welfare of others (Batson, 1991).
Showing empathy involves perspective shifting to imagine how
others are affected by the situation at hand (Batson et al., 1997).
Research on gender and empathy has shown that women tend to be
more empathetic toward others than men (Batson et al., 1996;
Gault & Sabini, 2000; Macaskill, Maltby, & Day, 2002; Toussaint
& Webb, 2005). Empathy drives a tone of communication that is
tactful and gentle, making it more effective for delivering emotionally laden speeches in a time of crisis. Because men tend to be
less empathetic, their communication with followers is often more
blunt, dominant, and forceful (Zahn, 1989).
Fourth, keeping a clear mind during a crisis benefits from
adaptive emotion regulation, defined as prospective shifting regarding activated emotions (Hülsheger, Alberts, Feinholdt, &
Lang, 2013). Research on gender and emotion regulation has
found that women are more likely than men to use positive
emotions in the service of reappraising negative situations (Bryant,
Smart, & King, 2005; Bryant & Verhoff, 2007; McRae, Ochsner,
Mauss, Gabrieli, & Gross, 2008). This enables women to more
adaptively handle the psychological setbacks they face.
Given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic,
mistakes are likely. Thus, leaders also need confidence to make
course corrections without overreacting or paralyzing the operations with doubt (Boin, Stern, & Sundelius, 2016; Stajkovic,
2006). Because women make causal attributions less tied to their
ability compared with men (Frieze, Whitley, Hanusa, & McHugh,
1982; Rosenthal, Guest, & Peccei, 1996), and external attributions
are positively related to maintaining confidence (Stajkovic &
Sommer, 2000), women are more likely than men to exude confidence in a crisis. Confidence, like empathy, can translate to
differences in communication patterns. For example, men seem to
communicate confidence by commanding attention and winning
arguments, with an aim to gain power (Maiorescu, 2016; Tannen,
2013). In contrast, most women perceive confidence as context
dependent; therefore, women tend to be more sensitive in exuding
confidence to their followers by focusing on immediately relevant
issues, not power (Alban-Metcalfe & West, 1991; Austin, Liu, &
Jin, 2014; Bussey & Bandura, 1999; Deaux & Major, 1987;
Gillian, 2003).
Taken together, these gender differences in thoughts and actions
may increase the likelihood that followers will respond differently
to messages from women leaders compared to men leaders. Accordingly, in the context of the present research, it seems plausible
that when governors issued stay-at-home orders before they became the norm, state residents might have responded more positively to briefings by women governors, ultimately saving lives.
That is, if women governors showed more empathy and confidence
in their briefings than men governors, that might have fostered

volitional compliance with their stay-at-home orders, which saved
lives.

Method and Results

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.

Quantitative Study
Data and measures. We used the “Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Data in the United States” file (henceforth, data) released by The
New York Times to capture number of deaths caused by COVID-19
in the United States.4 These data contained information for the 50
states in the United States, the District of Columba, and four U.S.
Territories (N ⫽ 55).5 The death count from COVID-19 was
reported in this data set by state, by day, from January 21, 2020 to
May 5, 2020. We combined these data with state population as of
July 1, 2019 from the U.S. Census Bureau, divided the population
numbers by 100,000 (M ⫽ 60.32, SD ⫽ 72.4), and mean-centered
them.
To test the interaction effect of governor sex and an issuance of
early stay-at-home orders on death count, we included a categorical variable to indicate whether states issued this order by March
23, 2020 (first wave; 0.5 ⫽ statewide order issued, 0 ⫽ orders in
parts of the state, and ⫺0.5 ⫽ no order issued) as reported by The
New York Times (Mervosh, Lu, & Swales, 2020). We coded sex as
a woman (0.5) or a man (⫺0.5) according to the roster posted
online by the National Governors’ Association.6 Governors’ average age was 58.2 years, (SD ⫽ 12.04), tenure in the current term
was 1.29 years (SD ⫽ 0.84), and the prior terms served was 0.42
(SD ⫽ 0.57).7
Results. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine whether governor sex and its interaction with an early
stay-at-home order was associated with a lower COVID-19 death
count. Following the best practice recommendations by Bernerth
and Aguinis (2016), we considered several covariates, including
the following sociodemographic variables: governor’s age, tenure,
number of previous terms served, political affiliation, and state
population. Prior research on leadership, as reported in Bernerth
and Aguinis (2016), commonly controls for age and tenure-related
variables to proxy for differences in a leader’s accrued knowledge
and other experience-related factors. Political science research has
established a relationship between gender and political affiliation
as political parties shape who runs for office and frequency of
initiatives to facilitate elections of women to office (Sanbonmatsu,
2010). Finally, infectious disease studies have found that state
population impacts deaths associated with virus transmissions
(Nolan et al., 1980).
The above covariates are based on theory and prior research.
The following covariates pertain to COVID-19 and were retrieved
from the COVID-19 State and Territory Actions Tracker available
on the National Governors’ Association’s website. We considered
whether states mandated residents to wear face masks to proxy for
risk of virus transmission; whether states banned domestic and
state-employee travel to control for interstate crossover in virus
infections; whether states enacted curfews to proxy for nonessential travel; and whether governors allowed hospitals to participate
in a ventilator sharing program to proxy for capacity.
Bivariate correlations of the study variables are reported in
Table 1. Following ANCOVA procedures (Keppel, 1991), to mitigate alternative explanations and to demonstrate the unique rela-

tionship between governor sex and COVID-19 deaths, we parsed
out the covariance between covariates and criterion variable. The
results of the full ANCOVA model are reported in Table 2. Results
indicated that several covariates were not significantly related to
COVID-19 deaths. Hence, we next ran a reduced ANCOVA model
and excluded covariates associated with death count at p ⬎ .10 in
Table 2. Results of the reduced ANCOVA model are reported in
Table 3. Results remain consistent when state population is added
to the reduced ANCOVA model.
Though results in both ANCOVA models supported our research question, we focus on the more parsimonious, reduced
ANCOVA model. In it, the main effect of governor sex was
significant; states with women governors had fewer COVID-19related deaths compared to states with male governors, F(1, 47) ⫽
5.98, p ⫽ .018, ␩p2 ⫽ .08. The interaction of governor sex and early
issuance of a stay-at-home order was also significant, F(1, 47) ⫽
7.74, p ⫽ .008, ␩p2 ⫽ .11; states with women governors who issued
an early stay-at-home order had fewer COVID-19 deaths compared to states with a male governor who issued the same order
(see Figure 1).

Qualitative Study
Data and measures. To shed insight into potential reasons for
the effects reported above, we next analyze the transcripts from
governmental briefings related to COVID-19 that took place between April 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020. These transcripts are
provided by the transcription company Rev, and they are available
on the company’s website.8 We analyzed 251 briefings, from 38
different state governors (including the mayor of the District of
Columbia), covering 1.2 million words spoken.9 Table 4 reports
descriptive information and quotes to illustrate differences in emphasis among the governors. To avoid confounding the effect of
the predictor variable, for each briefing, we analyzed words only
from the governor and excluded remarks from invited guests in the
briefing.
We used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) 2015
software (Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010) with built-in theme dictionaries to analyze the transcripts. These dictionaries are established by the LIWC manufacturer, have been validated (Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, & Blackburn, 2015), and have been used in
applied psychology research (Shantz & Latham, 2009). The software provides dictionaries that assess 41 psychological variables
and six personal concern categories. Our choice among these
available dictionaries was guided by theory discussed above.

The District of Columbia (D.C.) has no governor, but the mayor of
D.C. serves in a similar capacity to U.S. state governors. Hence, we used
the mayor’s demographic information for D.C.

From April 1 to May 5, 2020, the transcription company Rev.com only
transcribed briefings for the 38 governors included in this analysis. If those
governors who were not included in this analysis gave COVID-19-related
briefings during this period, the transcripts for those briefings were not
publicly available through this transcription service.

First, because empathy entails awareness of the feelings of
others, we used the LIWC “feelings” dictionary. This dictionary
assesses the frequency with which the speaker references feelingsassociated words (e.g., feelings, hard, tough, and pain). Second,
showing empathy entails acknowledging a concern for the welfare
of others. Thus, we analyzed the degree to which governors related
to their followers’ personal concerns. We chose the following three
personal categories that are likely on the minds of many during the
COVID-19 crisis: death (e.g., die, mourn, epidemic, war), money
(e.g., tax, income, loan, economy), and work (e.g., layoff, hire,
employ, job). Finally, we analyzed transcripts on the LIWC confidence dictionary (e.g., confident, daring, fearless, optimism, and
positive).10 The scores for each dictionary are the percent of words
that relate to the dictionary construct; for example, a score of 2.25
means 2.25% of the words spoken related to the construct. Despite
some governors issuing many briefings and others speaking rarely,
scores are computed as a percentage of total words and thus are
comparable.
Results. Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations are
reported in Table 5. Because political affiliation impacts the audience governors are accustomed to addressing and the priority of
topics tackled, and because it had a marginally significant correlation with feelings and confidence, we controlled for it. Moreover,
age was marginally correlated with gender in this analysis. Thus,
we ran an ANCOVA model in which gender was a predictor of the
LIWC criteria described above, controlling for political affiliation
and age. Additionally, Levitt et al. (2018) outlined standards for
reporting qualitative findings that called for “quotes or excerpts to
augment data” (p. 37) and to “demonstrate that findings are
grounded in evidence (e.g., using quotes)” (p. 36). Accordingly,
we report the qualitative findings and provide illustrative quotes
for each result.
Governor sex was related to outcomes examined. First, women
governors compared to men governors showed more empathy via
greater awareness of the feelings of others, F(1, 34) ⫽ 8.84, p ⫽
.005, ␩p2 ⫽ .21. This is exemplified by South Dakota Governor
Krisi Noem’s April 23, 2020 remarks:

There is a place you can go to talk to someone that can help you, not
just get answers to your financial issues, programs that may help you
get through, but somebody that may help you deal with some anxiety
or depression or lack of hope that you might be feeling today. You do
not have to go through this alone. Do not hesitate to reach out to me
personally, to reach out to my family because they are in the same
boat and feel the same feelings that you all do.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer also frequently discussed feelings
in her briefings: “The frustration and the pain are real, and the fear
is real . . . I understand the frustration that people are feeling. I’m
frustrated too” (April 15, 2020); “People are feeling very anxious.
People are worried about the business that they built . . . People are
worried about making the rent payment because they are out of
work” (April 17, 2020); “I know that . . . people are feeling
squirrelly from being at home so much with their family. I know
that people are worried about getting a job so that they can pay
their bills . . . I have those same fears” (April 29, 2020); “I know
that some people are angry and I know many are feeling restless.
I get it and I respect it and it’s okay to feel that way” (May 1,
2020).
Second, women governors showed more empathy than men
governors by taking an outward emotional response congruent
with their followers’ welfare by focusing more on relevant topics
of work, F(1, 34) ⫽ 11.53, p ⫽ .002, ␩p2 ⫽ .25, and money, F(1,
34) ⫽ 7.69, p ⫽ .009, ␩p2 ⫽ .18. To illustrate, consider the remarks
of South Dakota Governor Krisi Noem on April 6, 2020 when she
reassured her populace that “resources are available to you,
whether it be economic or mental health and labor unemployment.” Likewise, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly emphasized an
understanding for her people’s concerns related to their work on
April 3, 2020 when she said, “That’s what I want to talk about
today. Kansas jobs and small businesses and how we can support

The LIWC manufacturer titles this dictionary “reward.” However,
upon review of the words included in this dictionary, a title of “confidence”
rather than “reward,” is a more accurate portrayal.

them, save them, and create them when the danger of COVID-19
is behind us.” As illustrated, women governors spoke about work
and money to connect with followers by painting a brighter future
ahead. In contrast, speaking about death would call attention to the
tragic consequences of COVID-19. Hence, death was not spoken
about differentially by gender (p ⫽ .12). For context, the mean
death mention was 0.11% of words spoken, suggesting that most
governors avoided talking about it.
Third, women governors exuded more confidence compared
with men governors, F(1, 34) ⫽ 3.74, p ⫽ .061, ␩p2 ⫽ .10.11 For
example, on April 27, 2020, Governor Gretchen Whitmer asserted
to her state, “We are not out of the woods yet, but we are seeing
signs to give us reason to be feeling optimistic; cautiously, but
optimistic nonetheless.” On April 13, 2020, Governor Gina Raimondo assured her public, “I am confident that by working together and sharing our best ideas, we will be much, much more
likely to get it right for the citizens of our state.”

Discussion
Our quantitative analysis revealed that states with women governors had fewer COVID-19 deaths than states with men governors. This finding is consistent with both microlevel studies suggesting that women tend to be preferred as leaders during times of
poor organizational performance and uncertainty (Ashby et al.,
2007; Bruckmüller & Branscombe, 2010) and macrolevel research
linking women’s presence in high leadership positions to better
firm performance (Davis, Babakus, Englis, & Pett, 2010; Haslam,
Ryan, Kulich, Trojanowski, & Atkins, 2010; Hoobler et al., 2018;
Post & Byron, 2015). Given the multifaceted severity of the
COVID-19 crisis, this finding extends prior research by demonstrating that women leaders tend to be effective beyond just a
moderate-level organizational crisis (cf., Vongas & Al Hajj, 2015).
We also found that governor sex interacted with early stay-athome orders. Women governors who issued early stay-at-home

orders had fewer COVID-19 deaths in their states than men governors who issued the same orders. This suggests that state residents perhaps responded differently depending on whether a man
or woman governor issued this order, as manifested by lives saved.
This finding supports literature suggesting that a leader’s message
partly determines how the followers respond to it (Boin et al.,
2016). That is, our qualitative results lend insight to suggest that
stay-at-home orders issued by women governors were potentially
delivered with greater empathy and confidence compared to men
governors. This qualitative difference in briefing messages is consistent with research showing that women tend to be more sensitive to the needs of those around them and express themselves
accordingly (Gillian, 2003; Zahn, 1989). Together, the quantitative
interaction and qualitative results suggest that state residents might
have responded to early state-at-home orders from women governors more positively with greater volitional compliance than to
such orders by men governors.
Our crossed (micro-macro) and multimethod (quantitativequalitative) research helps mitigate a “black box” problem in this
literature, defined as scarcity of theory regarding mediators
(Hoobler et al., 2018; Post & Byron, 2015). In probing for psychological mechanisms linking women to leadership effectiveness
during COVID-19, we found that content of the briefings differed
between women and men governors in terms of two important
psychological variables: empathy and confidence. Adding nuance
to the notion of communication sensitivity in a crisis, our findings
illustrate how gender differences can manifest in speeches to
followers. This is important because leaders (e.g., governors)
11

typically inspire people, and managers (e.g., in state agencies)
manage processes (Bertocci, 2009). Whether state agencies, first
responders, and people are confident that they can do what it takes
to get through a crisis and bounce back partly depends on the
leader’s rhetoric (Boin & McConnell, 2007; Brescoll, 2011; Drabek, 1986). Even when people have the skills, many forsake
pursuits if they doubt they can do what it takes. In our sample,
women governors seemed to have emphasized confidence more
than men governors.

Limitations
The COVID-19 pandemic was started by a rapid virus pathogenesis over which little appreciable control existed (Rothan &

Byrareddy, 2020). The results we report are current but could
change when counts are final. However, there is an uncertainty
about a recurrence of the virus in late 2020 (Lovelace &
Breuninger, 2020). In the meantime, we responded to a call for
research on the facilitative role of applied psychology during the
pandemic. Because the data were not experimental, which is
impossible with our criterion variable, no causality can be inferred
from our results, just patterns of associations. Our aim was to offer
timely insight on the role of gender in leadership effectiveness
during an unprecedented time of crisis and uncertainty.
Although it has been used in applied psychology research
(Shantz & Latham, 2009), the LIWC analysis is only as accurate as
the data it analyzes. Because we used public transcripts, if words

by governors were altered by the third-party transcription, this can
impact results. Also, the LIWC does not understand sarcasm.
These limitations are somewhat mitigated by the large number (1.2
million) of words analyzed. Relatedly, because the quantitative
and qualitative analyses were derived from two data sources, we
cannot test a model in which empathy and confidence mediate the
impact of sex on COVID-19 deaths within the same model of
influence.
Our data were publicly available; thus, we tested gender according to biological sex. Our research question, though, draws from
literature on social roles and social cognition, both of which are
mediated by psychosocial processes. For this reason, men can also
exhibit traditionally feminine qualities (Ely & Padavic, 2007;
Mensi-Klarbach, 2014) because gender roles emerge from an
individual’s activities throughout role development (Eagly, Wood,

& Diekman, 2000). Therefore, not all women have different leadership styles from all men (Hoobler et al., 2018).

Practical Implications
We cannot control state election results nor sex of the governor.
However, consistent with Post and Byron (2015), our findings
underscore that states with a women governor are not just “tokenism” (p. 1562) or a “numbers game” (p. 1563) as we found women
governors cultivated empathy and confidence more in their
COVID-19 briefings than did men governors. The juxtaposition of
these findings with prior research underscores the need to value
different leadership voices and to build a culture of inclusion in
which varied voices are heard and valued.

In the absence of women governors or women organizational
leaders during a crisis, effort can be put forth to diversify leadership teams with individuals who show empathy and confidence. In
organizations, these attributes could be enhanced with training or
selected during hiring (Gibson, 2004). Most organizations still
have hierarchical structures (Donkin, 2010); thus, organizing seminars or adopting hiring criteria appears relatively straightforward.
Women’s leadership in public office is more prone to be moderated by sociocultural context. For example, women who express
empathy versus men who express empathy are more readily accepted in many societies, but embracing confidence from women
leaders is a tougher sell in some cultures (Bandura, 1995, 2006).
For this reason, implementing a program to unobtrusively change
gendered stereotypes at a societal level is easier said than done. For
example, research on subtle forms of prejudice (see Sergent &
Stajkovic, 2019 for a review) suggests that simply discussing
gender issues increases the salience of gender prejudice. Thus, in
addition to calling for needed change, following up with constructive conversations is needed to sift through ways in which preconceived views about gender stereotypes can be updated.

Conclusion
COVID-19 was an exogenous shock that dramatically affected
individuals, organizations, and societies. We leveraged this lifeand-death pandemic to reexamine the growing postulate in the
literature that women seem to be more effective leaders than men
in a crisis. We focused on U.S. governors for they face extraordinary leadership trials during COVID-19. In addition to decisionmaking under uncertainty, governors need to reassure and persuade state residents to volitionally follow through on the orders,
even when they come with rare personal costs—for example,
social distancing. We found that states with women governors had
fewer COVID-19 deaths than states with men governors, and when
governors issued an early stay-at-home order, states with women
governors were more responsive, as borne out by fewer COVID-19
deaths. The qualitative analysis indicated a potential mechanism
for that effect may be that women governors were more empathetic
and confident, as shown in their briefings. Beyond the COVID-19
crisis, the gender leadership dynamics discussed and examined
herein are likely to unfold when uncertainty permeates business
and society.
