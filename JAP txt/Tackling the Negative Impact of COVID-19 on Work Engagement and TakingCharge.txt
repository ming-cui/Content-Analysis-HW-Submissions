The COVID-19 pandemic, as a stressful event, has posed unprecedented challenges for employees worldwide.
This research investigated whether and when an employee’s perceived COVID-19 crisis strength affected his or
her work engagement and taking charge at work. In a time-lagged ﬁeld study of health workers on the
coronavirus frontline (Study 1), we found that when work meaningfulness was lower, a health worker’s
perceived COVID-19 crisis strength exerted a more negative effect on his or her work engagement and taking
charge at work. In a longitudinal ﬁeld experiment (Study 2), we collaborated with a hospital to carry out two
organizational interventions based on event system theory and work meaningfulness r esearch. The interventions signiﬁcantly decreased perceived COVID-19 crisis strength and increased work meaningfulness for
medical staff in an intensive care unit (ICU), who were tasked with caring for COVID-19 patients in critical
condition. The ﬁndings of Study 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of organizational training and interventions in
alleviating the negative impact of COVID-19 on an employee’s work engagement and taking charge at work.

Training proves to be the key ingredient to handling any disaster.

(e.g., energy and time) toward one’s work (Rich et al., 2010). As a
type of proactive behavior, taking charge at work “entails voluntary
and constructive efforts, by individual employees, to effect organizationally functional change with respect to how work is executed
within the contexts of their jobs, work units, or organizations”
(Morrison & Phelps, 1999, p. 403). In today’s rapidly evolving
work environment, work engagement and taking charge at work
are critical to individual effectiveness and organizational success
(Bakker & Albrecht, 2018; Kim et al., 2015).
The transactional model of stress suggests that the impact of a
stressful event may depend on the extent to which individuals consider
the event relevant or meaningful in a given context (Lazarus, 1966,
1993; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, 1987). A relevant stressful event is
more likely to capture people’s attention and subsequently alter their
behavior. In the workplace, work meaningfulness—that is, the perception that one’s daily job responsibilities have a broader signiﬁcance—
may determine whether an employee views a stressful event as
relevant and pays heed to it (Rosso et al., 2010). Finding meaning
in work enables employees to concentrate on their jobs and reduces
their susceptibility to stressful events in context (Soane et al., 2013;
Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004). Work meaningfulness also broadens
employees’ thought–action repertoires and enables them to reenergize
and refocus on their work quickly (Soane et al., 2013; Tugade &
Fredrickson, 2004). When confronted with a stressful event, which
consumes one’s personal resources, employees with higher levels of
work meaningfulness are better prepared to recover effectively and
efﬁciently (Crawford et al., 2019; Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000).
Accordingly, in this research, we also examine whether work meaningfulness may act as a moderator to buffer employees from the
negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on employees. Doing so can
generate valuable theoretical and practical insights into when an
employee’s perceived COVID-19 crisis strength will be more likely

The COVID-19 pandemic is a stressful event that has substantially
affected employees. Initial research has indicated that employee
productivity has fallen by a dramatic 35% since the onset of this
global health crisis (van Hoof, 2020). According to the stress literature, stressful events drain cognitive resources and drive emotional
exhaustion, thereby disengaging employees from work and tempering
their ability to be proactive (Eatough et al., 2011; Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984). The transactional model of stress underscores the
notion that one’s perception of a stressful event will shape one’s
response to the event (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, 1987). A major
purpose of this research is thus to examine whether an employee’s
perceived COVID-19 crisis strength will decrease an employee’s
work engagement and taking charge at work. Work engagement
reﬂects the extent to which one actively allocates personal resources

to deteriorate the employee’s work engagement and taking charge at
work (Colquitt & Zapata-Phelan, 2007).
Currently, organizations around the world are designing and
implementing training and intervention strategies to combat the
negative effects of the COVID-19 crisis in the workplace (Alessi,
2020). Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, for example,
recently argued that ﬁrms should prioritize actions that reduce the
behavioral and psychological problems faced by employees amid
COVID-19 (Alessi, 2020). Hence, in addition to demonstrating the
harmful effects of the COVID-19 crisis on employees, we boost the
practical implications of our research by developing and ﬁeldtesting two psychological interventions intended to foster work
engagement and taking-charge behaviors in health workers on
the frontline against COVID-19.

Theory and Hypotheses
The Main Effects of Perceived COVID-19 Crisis Strength
on Work Engagement and Taking Charge at Work
The transactional model of stress emphasizes that a stressful event
should be considered in terms of its strength or severity to the
individual, because “how a person construes an event shapes the
emotional and behavioral response” (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984,
p. 24). In other words, an individual’s perception of the strength of a
stressful event directly leads to the individual outcomes. Accordingly, psychology scholars have begun to test the relationship
between one’s perceived strength of stressful life events and
well-being empirically (e.g., You & Conner, 2009). Curiously,
there is still an insufﬁcient understanding of the inﬂuence of the
perceived strength of macro events or crises on employee psychological states and behaviors in organizational settings (Liu et al.,
2018; Morgeson et al., 2015).
As suggested by the transactional model of stress, employees who
perceive the COVID-19 crisis to be more severe will feel compelled
to direct more personal attention and energy to protect their family,
friends, and themselves from harm (Berjot & Gillet, 2011; Lazarus,
1991). Consequently, these employees will then feel exhausted and
have fewer resources available to devote to their work (Chen et al.,
2013). They will experience a lack of control and have difﬁculty
concentrating on their job tasks, which can cause them to disengage
from their work roles (Leigh & Melwani, 2019) and be unable to
exercise taking-charge behavior (Eatough et al., 2011; Sonnentag &
Frese, 2003). Conversely, employees who consider the COVID-19
crisis to be less severe will pay less attention and dedicate fewer
resources to the crisis. COVID-19 will be less likely to hinder their
ability to engage in work activities and go the extra mile to serve
their organizations. Therefore, we propose:
Hypothesis 1: An employee’s perceived COVID-19 crisis
strength is negatively related to his or her work engagement.
Hypothesis 2: An employee’s perceived COVID-19 crisis
strength is negatively related to his or her taking charge at work.

The Moderating Effects of Work Meaningfulness
As argued above, in the framework of the transactional model of
stress, the effect of a stressful event on subsequent outcomes

depends on the degree to which individuals regard the event as
relevant or meaningful in a given context (Lazarus & Folkman,
1984, 1987). In organizations, work meaningfulness reﬂects the
extent to which individuals interpret their work as personally
meaningful relative to other stimuli, and may prompt employees
to concentrate on their work and become less likely to have their
attention diverted and resources exhausted by non-work cues (Rosso
et al., 2010). Employees who ascribe a strong meaning to their work
will continue to make signiﬁcant personal investments and exhibit
high levels of engagement and taking-charge behaviors even in the
midst of a crisis (Lips-Wiersma & Wright, 2012; Steger
et al., 2012).
Furthermore, employees with a strong sense of work meaningfulness will remain better positioned to recharge and refocus on their
jobs, even when COVID-19 triggers emotional and cognitive
exhaustion (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000; Soane et al., 2013). In
contrast, employees with low levels of work meaningfulness are
more inclined to deprioritize their jobs and be distracted by the
challenges and difﬁculties arising from the COVID-19 crisis (Steger
et al., 2012). Such employees may not only be more prone to
disengage from work and refrain from taking charge, but also
require a longer recovery period during times of crisis (Arnold &
Walsh, 2015; Park & Folkman, 1997). Studies have veriﬁed that
work meaningfulness can buffer the impact of stressful conditions
by reducing employees’ susceptibility to emotional exhaustion
(Tummers & Den Dulk, 2013) and allowing them to cultivate better
occupational well-being (Soane et al., 2013). Accordingly, work
meaningfulness may mitigate the negative effects of perceived
COVID-19 crisis strength on work engagement and taking charge
at work (Figure 1). Speciﬁcally,
Hypothesis 3: Work meaningfulness moderates the negative
relationship between an employee’s perceived COVID-19 crisis strength and work engagement, such that the relationship
will be less negative when work meaningfulness is higher.
Hypothesis 4: Work meaningfulness moderates the negative
relationship between an employee’s perceived COVID-19 crisis strength and taking charge at work, such that the relationship
will be less negative when work meaningfulness is higher.

Organizational Interventions to Ameliorate the
Negative Impact of COVID-19
Drawing on event system theory and the work meaningfulness
literature, we further propose two interventions that organizations
can adopt to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on their
employees’ work engagement and taking charge at work. According
to event system theory, the perceived strength of an event or crisis is
reﬂected in its novelty, disruption, and criticality (Morgeson et al.,
2015). In this context, novelty is the extent to which employees
consider COVID-19 new and unexpected; disruption reﬂects the
extent to which they perceive that their existing tasks are interrupted
by COVID-19; and criticality gauges the extent to which they
believe that COVID-19 will signiﬁcantly affect their long-term
development (Morgeson et al., 2015). Accordingly, organizations
can reduce employees’ perceived COVID-19 crisis strength or
severity by designing interventions to minimize perceptions of

the crisis’s novelty, disruption, and criticality. As noted in the
literature on work meaningfulness, organizations can enhance
work meaningfulness by strengthening the sense that their employees’ work makes signiﬁcant contributions to the organization’s
goals, other people’s well-being, and the employees’ own personal
growth and development (Carton, 2018; Frieder et al., 2018; Loi
et al., 2018). As such, we collaborated with a hospital where
COVID-19 patients were treated to implement a longitudinal ﬁeld
experiment (Study 2) with the aims of examining the following
research question and ultimately assisting organizations in their
efforts to combat COVID-19:
Research question: Can organizations boost employee work
engagement and taking charge at work by implementing interventions to decrease perceived COVID-19 crisis strength and
increase work meaningfulness among employees?

Overview of Empirical Studies
First, we tested our hypotheses by conducting a time-lagged ﬁeld
survey of nurses, who provided care to COVID-19 patients (Study
1). Next, we addressed the above research question by conducting a
longitudinal ﬁeld experiment (Study 2) in an intensive care unit
(ICU) for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. The combination
of a ﬁeld survey and a ﬁeld experiment enabled us to verify both the
internal and external validity of our research.1

2020; Pearman et al., in press), making them an appropriate sample
to test our hypotheses. Our research was conducted at a major
hospital in Chengdu, China. To minimize disruptions to hospital
operations, the human resources (HR) department of this hospital
assisted us in randomly selecting 268 nurses and their direct leaders
(26 head nurses), who were involved in caring for COVID-19
patients and encouraging them to participate in our survey. The
participants completed our on-site surveys over a 6-week period and
returned the surveys directly to us. At time 1, we surveyed 268
nurses regarding their perceived COVID-19 crisis strength, work
meaningfulness, and demographic data and received responses from
266 nurses (99.25% response rate). At time 2 (3 weeks after time 1),
the 266 responding nurses were invited to rate their work engagement. We received responses from 258 nurses (96.99% response
rate). At time 3 (3 weeks after time 2), the 26 head nurses rated the
258 nurses’ taking-charge behaviors (100% response rate). Among
the 258 nurses, 165 (63.95%) were younger than 30 years, 231
(89.53%) held an associate’s degree or above, and 220 (85.27%)
were female. On average, the nurses had 7.96 years of work
experience (SD = 6.23). We compared our ﬁnal sample
(n = 258) with the initial sample (n = 266) in terms of demographics, perceived COVID-19 crisis strength, and employee
work meaningfulness. No signiﬁcant differences between the two
groups were found in terms of age (F = .82, not signiﬁcant (ns)),
gender (F = .03, ns), education (F = .40, ns), tenure (F = .07, ns),

Sample and Procedure
Frontline healthcare workers place themselves at high risk of
contracting COVID-19 and encounter numerous physical and psychological challenges. For example, at least 22 healthcare workers in
China had died of COVID-19 by the end of February 2020, and
more than 3,300 had tested positive as of early March 2020 (The
Lancet, 2020). Frontline health workers worldwide have regarded
the COVID-19 crisis as an extraordinarily stressful event (Lu et al.,

The data were collected by the second author, whose afﬁliated university
in China does not have an Institutional Review Board (IRB) but requires its
researchers to adhere to the rights granted to human subjects, including the
participant’s rights to privacy, conﬁdentiality, informed consent, dignity,

privacy of the data collected about human subjects, as declared in the
Nuremberg Code, 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, and other international
conventions on human rights. As an independent third party, the Associate
Dean for Research of the business school with which the second author is
afﬁliated has reviewed and approved the research materials. The entire data
collection procedures fully complied with the above requirements.

perceived COVID-19 crisis strength (F = .07, ns), or work meaningfulness (F = 1.27, ns).

‘situational strength’ reﬂects the extent to which situations can
constrain behavior (Mischel, 1969).”

Measures

Work Meaningfulness (α = .94)

All of the measures described below have been established and
veriﬁed in previous studies. We applied the translation and backtranslation procedure to achieve a linguistic equivalence between
the English and Chinese versions of the measures (Brislin, 1986).
We invited two bilingual organizational behavior scholars to review
the content validity and clarity of the measures. We then made
several minor changes to the wordings of the items based on their
feedback. Unless otherwise noted, ﬁve-point Likert scales ranging
from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree were used (see
Appendix A for all measurement items).

The nurses rated their work meaningfulness using Spreitzer
(1995) 3-item measure. A sample item is, “My job activities are
personally meaningful to me.”

Work Engagement (α = .93)
The nurses rated their work engagement using the 9-item Work
Engagement Scale from Schaufeli et al. (2006) on a scale from
1 = never to 5 = always. A representative item is, “I am immersed
in my work.”

Taking Charge at Work (α = .94)

Perceived COVID-19 Crisis Strength (α = .79)
Consistent with research related to event system theory, the nurses
rated their perceived COVID-19 crisis strength using an 11-item
measure that included the three dimensions of novelty, disruption, and
criticality (Morgeson, 2005; Morgeson & DeRue, 2006; Morgeson
et al., 2015). A sample item is, “The COVID-19 crisis disrupts my
ability to get my work done.” A second-order conﬁrmatory factor
analysis (CFA) showed that all of the items signiﬁcantly loaded onto
their corresponding three dimensions, which signiﬁcantly loaded onto
an overall second-order factor that measured perceived COVID-19
crisis strength. This second-order CFA model ﬁts the data well
(χ2 (41) = 90.39, TLI = .94, CFI = .95, RMSEA = .07), suggesting
that the items could be aggregated into a composite score for
subsequent analyses (Wong et al., 2008). This ﬁnding is consistent
with Morgeson et al. (2015, p. 522), who noted that, “although we
have discussed each of the event characteristics separately, it is clear
that all three are present in varying amounts in every event. A key
question thus revolves around how they combine to inﬂuence behaviors, features, and events. We suggest that they combine in an
additive fashion, where the conﬂuence of event characteristics determines the overall ‘strength’ of an event, much in the same way that

The supervisors rated nurses’ taking-charge behaviors using a 5item scale (Grant et al., 2011). A sample item is, “This nurse tried to
bring about improved procedures for the hospital.”

Control Variables
We included team size (natural logarithm of the number of team
employees) and team age (years) as team-level controls (Sonnentag,
2003). At the individual level, we controlled for an employee’s age,
gender, years of work experience, and education level (Grant et al.,
2011; Hartog & Belschak, 2007).

Analytical Strategy and Results
Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics and inter-correlations
between the study variables. We conducted a CFA with AMOS 7 to
verify the discriminant validity of the multiple-item variables. The
hypothesized four-factor model (perceived COVID-19 crisis
strength, work meaningfulness, work engagement, and taking
charge at work) yielded an acceptable ﬁt to the data, and all of
the factor loadings were signiﬁcant: χ2(338) = 554.40, CFI = .96,

TACKLING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF COVID-19

TLI = .95, and RMSEA = .05. This model ﬁtted the data signiﬁcantly better than all six constrained models in which any two of the
four variables were set to load on a single factor (122.85 ≤ Δχ2
(Δdf = 1) ≤ 688.02).
As our data were nested under teams, we tested a two-level
random slope model using grand-mean centering with HLM 6.08
(see Appendix B for a more detailed description of our analytical
procedure). In support of Hypothesis 1, the results of Model 2 in
Table 2 indicate that perceived COVID-19 crisis strength was
negatively related to work engagement (γ = −.31, p < .01). The
results of Model 5 in Table 2 reveal that perceived COVID-19 crisis
strength was negatively but non-signiﬁcantly related to taking
charge at work (γ = −.02, ns), thereby not supporting Hypothesis 2.
In keeping with Hypothesis 3, the results of Model 3 in Table 2
indicate that the interaction between perceived COVID-19 crisis
strength and work meaningfulness was positively related to work
engagement (γ = .41, p < .01). Figure 2 and slope tests show that
the negative relationship between perceived COVID-19 crisis
strength and work engagement became non-signiﬁcant when
work meaningfulness was higher (γ = −.11, ns) versus lower
(γ = −.53, p < .01). Consistent with Hypothesis 4, the results of
Model 6 in Table 2 indicate that the interaction between perceived
COVID-19 crisis strength and work meaningfulness was positively
related to taking charge at work (γ = .40, p < .01). Figure 3 and
slope tests demonstrate that the negative relationship between
perceived COVID-19 crisis strength and taking charge at work
became non-signiﬁcant when work meaningfulness was higher
(γ = .18, ns) versus lower (γ = −.31, p < .01).

Study 2: Longitudinal Field Experiment
Sample and Procedure
In Study 2, the targeted participants were the 64 medical professionals employed at an ICU for COVID-19 patients in critical

condition. The ICU was located in the same hospital as in Study 1.
Our interview with the hospital leaders revealed that mitigating the
negative impact of COVID-19 on these medical professionals who
were on the COVID-19 frontline was crucial for promoting
employee morale and providing quality care for patients. Three
medical professionals who agreed to participate dropped out of the
study because of time constraints and did not complete the pre- and
post-intervention assessments, leaving a ﬁnal sample of 61 participants. Of the 61 participants in the ﬁnal sample, 55 (90.16%) were
younger than 40 years, 60 (98.36%) had an associate’s degree or
above, and 40 (65.57%) were women. On average, the employees
had 8.82 years of work experience (SD = 4.62). There were no
signiﬁcant demographic differences across the experimental and
control conditions.
We adopted a 2 (COVID-19 crisis intervention or not) × 2 (work
meaningfulness intervention or not) between-participant factorial
design with repeated (pre- and post-intervention) measures
(Campbell & Stanley, 2015). The studied ICU was staffed with
nurses, doctors, and support staff (e.g., dieticians, phlebotomists,
and radiologists). With the assistance of the hospital’s HR department, we sought to assign these three groups of employees randomly
and uniformly to three experimental conditions and one control
condition (Shadish et al., 2002). Finally, 15 participants (10 nurses,
4 doctors, and 1 support staff) received both interventions, 15 (9
nurses, 3 doctors, and 3 support staff) received the COVID-19 crisis
intervention only, 16 (11 nurses, 2 doctors, and 3 support staff)
received the work meaningfulness intervention only, and 15 (9
nurses, 3 doctors, and 3 support staff) received neither intervention
(control group). Medical professionals provided pre-intervention
(early March 2020) and post-intervention (2 weeks after the intervention) data on perceived COVID-19 crisis strength, work meaningfulness, and work engagement. Their supervisors, who did
not participate in the experiment and were blinded to the experimental versus control conditions, provided pre-intervention and

post-intervention data on these medical professionals’ taking-charge
behaviors.
In line with prior ﬁeld experiments (e.g., McNatt & Judge, 2004),
we designed the two interventions described below (see Appendix C
for additional details), which were then reviewed by the hospital’s
vice president for training and development, as well as HR staff, to
ensure their appropriateness and effectiveness. For the ﬁrst intervention, the vice president provided a counseling session to the
groups receiving the COVID-19 crisis intervention (n = 15) and
both interventions (n = 15). Event system theory suggests that an
event’s perceived strength reﬂects how novel, disruptive, and critical it is perceived to be (Morgeson et al., 2015). Accordingly, during
the session, the vice president attempted to reduce medical professionals’ perceived COVID-19 crisis strength by mitigating their

perceived novelty, disruption, and criticality of COVID-19. For the
second intervention, the vice president sent an ofﬁcial letter (via
both email and mail) to each member in the groups receiving the
work meaningfulness intervention (n = 16) and both interventions
(n = 15). Consistent with the literature on work meaningfulness, the
letter stressed the importance of the medical professionals’ work in
three areas: fulﬁlling the hospital’s goal of providing excellent
medical service to patients (Carton, 2018), enhancing patients’
well-being and health (Frieder et al., 2018), and fostering personal
growth and development (Robertson et al., 2020). The letter also
stressed that these aspects had become particularly meaningful amid
the COVID-19 crisis. After the experiment, a co-author who was a
senior HR manager at the hospital interviewed ﬁve participants and
asked them about their experiences during Study 2. None of them

As shown in Table 5, the results of repeated-measures
ANOVA reveal a signiﬁcant interactive effect of 2 (pre- vs. postintervention) × 2 (COVID-19 crisis strength intervention vs. control) × 2 (work meaningfulness intervention vs. control) ANOVA
on work engagement (F(1, 57) = 4.49, p < .05, η2 = .07, d = .55).
Among those who received the work meaningfulness intervention,
medical professionals in the COVID-19 crisis strength intervention
group (t[14] = 7.36, p < .01, mean increase = 1.01, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = [.72, 1.31]) experienced a larger increase
in work engagement (F(1, 29) = 10.82, p < .01, η2 = .27, d = 1.22)
than did those in the non-COVID-19 crisis strength intervention
group (t[15] = 2.63, p < .05, mean increase = .37, 95% CI = [.07,
.67]). Among those who did not receive the work meaningfulness
intervention, medical professionals in the COVID-19 crisis strength
intervention group (t[14] = 2.40, p < .05, mean increase = .19,

Repeated-measures ANOVA, which can account for pre-intervention differences and post-intervention changes in the outcome
variables, was applied to examine the intervention effectiveness as
well as the research question (Martin et al., 2013). Table 5 displays
the repeated-measures ANOVA results.
The results of repeated-measures ANOVA show a signiﬁcant
interactive effect of time (pre- versus post-intervention) and condition (COVID-19 crisis strength intervention vs. control) on perceived COVID-19 crisis strength (F(1, 57) = 20.05, p < .01, η2 = .26,
d = 1.19). Perceived COVID-19 crisis strength decreased signiﬁcantly in the COVID-19 crisis strength intervention group
(t[14] = 6.35, p < .01) but not in the control group (t [14] = .26, ns).
These results support the effectiveness of the COVID-19 crisis
strength intervention. The ﬁndings of repeated-measures ANOVA

Discussion
This research, which included a time-lagged ﬁeld survey and a
longitudinal ﬁeld experiment, yielded ﬁndings with meaningful
theoretical and practical implications for investigating and combating stressful events or crises.

workplace experiences. By reinforcing the value of the integrative
theory-building approach, our research may enable a more comprehensive understanding of how an employee’s internal attributes can
alleviate or exacerbate the effect of an exogenous event, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Practical Implications
Theoretical Implications
From an event theory-building perspective, this research contributes
to an emerging stream of behavioral research on the COVID-19 crisis
and its consequences. As a major global health crisis, the COVID-19
pandemic has posed numerous challenges to employees (Restubog
et al., 2020). Whereas most psychological studies and theories have
centered on the static features of contexts and individuals (Chen et al.,
in press; Jiang et al., 2019; Johns, 2017), our ﬁndings suggest that
research should be reﬁned by a greater focus on discrete and acute
events that may also signiﬁcantly affect individuals in organizations.
As Liu et al. (2018, p. 804) noted, “engaging events is not only
important as a theoretical extension but also critical for promoting the
empirical rigor in this line of research.”
Based on the transactional model of stress (Lazarus, 1993;
Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), this research conceptualizes the
COVID-19 crisis as a stressful event and explores its substantial
effects on employees’ psychological states (e.g., work engagement)
and workplace behaviors (e.g., taking charge). Organizational studies have tended to overlook the fact that one’s internal attributes can
unfold in tandem with events (Liu et al., 2018). Event system theory
thus calls for an integrative theory-building approach to studying the
interplay between external events and one’s internal state, which
“may enable the development of more ﬁne-grained organizational
theories, enhancing their explanatory power and impact” (Morgeson
et al., 2015, p. 530). Accordingly, we have taken an integrative
theory-building approach by highlighting the interplay between the
strength of an external event (i.e., the COVID-19 crisis) and one’s
psychological features (i.e., work meaningfulness). We found that
an employee’s perceived work meaningfulness may function as a
crucial buffer against the encroachment of a crisis on his or her

Our research not only reveals the negative impact of COVID-19
on employees, but also suggests viable solutions. First, our ﬁndings
suggest that managers should continuously monitor employee work
engagement and taking charge at work, especially when unexpected
events (e.g., the COVID-19 crisis) arise. Any decline in employee
work engagement and taking-charge behaviors should immediately
be met with appropriate interventions, such as those veriﬁed in our
ﬁeld experiment using a sample of frontline health workers tasked
with providing care to COVID-19 patients (Study 2). These interventions represent a useful set of tools that can be used by
organizations to grapple with the COVID-19 crisis.
As demonstrated by this research, organizational leaders and HR
staff can apply event system theory to design training and intervention programs intended to mitigate their employees’ perceived
COVID-19 crisis strength by countering perceptions of the crisis
as novel, disruptive, and critical (Morgeson et al., 2015). In addition, our work meaningfulness intervention tested in Study 2
exempliﬁes a theoretically sound and empirically supported strategy
that managers can use to promote work meaningfulness. Such a
strategy can help employees understand their signiﬁcant contributions to organizational goals, the well-being of others, and their own
personal growth (Florian et al., 2019; Loi et al., 2018).

Limitations and Directions for Future Research
Inevitably, this study has several limitations that point to promising future research avenues. First, we examined the effects of
perceived COVID-19 crisis strength at the individual level. However, COVID-19 may affect the entire organizational hierarchy and
even inter-organizational relationships (Liu et al., 2018). Future

research should therefore explore whether, how, and when COVID19 may induce changes across different organizational levels and
between organizations. Second, from an employee-centric perspective, we proposed and tested work meaningfulness as the moderator
that would attenuate the negative inﬂuence of perceived COVID-19
crisis strength on work engagement and taking-charge behavior.
However, other moderators regarding leaders, coworkers, and family
members also warrant investigation. For example, spousal love may
provide support to employees and enable them to solve the problems
introduced by COVID-19. Third, probably due to our small sample
size in each of the four conditions in the longitudinal ﬁeld experiment
(Study 2), our analyses revealed strong manipulation effects, which
were coupled with low levels of variance. As a result, the effect sizes
may have been overestimated. Future research should adopt a larger
sample size to further examine the effectiveness of our designed
interventions (Gerber & Green, 2012). Finally, as per the studied
hospital’s request, we switched from a 3-week time interval in Study 1
to a 2-week time interval in Study 2. Previous work engagement
studies have adopted 2- and 3-week time intervals (e.g., Karatepe
et al., 2014; Vogel et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019). In future studies,
however, it would be interesting to explore whether our interventions
may induce sufﬁciently persistent effects across different time frames.

Conclusions
Our event-oriented research increases scholarly understanding of
whether and when the COVID-19 crisis impinges upon employees’
psychological states and behaviors at work. While organizations are
faced with heightened concerns and apprehensions regarding the
repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate that
organizations can soften the impact of this crisis on their employees
by providing interventions designed to weaken perceived COVID-19
crisis strength and strengthen work meaningfulness. We hope that this
research will encourage scholars and practitioners to jointly come to
grips with the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Procedure of Data Analysis for Study 1
We speciﬁed all of the hypothesized relationships at the individual level and tested the hypotheses using a two-level random-slope
model, which allowed an estimated level-1 slope to vary randomly
across teams and thus yielded more generalizable ﬁndings, compared to using a ﬁxed-slope model (Hannah et al., 2016;
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Previous studies that analyzed a model
similar to ours have generally used grand-mean centering, wherein
all the variables in the hypotheses reside at level 1 (e.g., Harman
et al., 2015; Hofman & Gavin, 1998; Taylor et al., 2019).

Note. All the variables were entered after grand-mean centering.

Accordingly, we ﬁrst grand-mean centered all the variables to
test the hypotheses (Table 2). In addition, following past multilevel
research (e.g., Ilies et al., 2017; Schaubroeck et al., 2018), we
speciﬁed random slopes for the variables in the hypotheses and
ﬁxed the slopes for the control variables (see the formulas for models
2, 3, and 6 in Table B1). Given the small sample size of level 2
(n = 26), we reported the more conservative asymptotic standard
error estimates (Raudenbush et al., 2004; Raudenbush & Bryk,
2002). Although the centering method is a greater concern when
testing a cross-level interaction (Gavin & Hofmann, 2002; Hofmann &
Gavin, 1998), we also tested the model using group-mean centering
to verify the robustness of our ﬁndings. Notably, using either
centering approach, our hypotheses testing conclusions remained
the same whether based on asymptotic standard errors or robust
standard errors. The HLM results based on these two standard error
estimation methods only differed in terms of some standard error
estimates.

Appendix C
Intervention Materials for Study 2
Perceived COVID-19 Crisis Strength Intervention
During a counseling session, the vice president of the participating hospital delivered the following key points intended to decrease
the perceived COVID-19 crisis strength among medical professionals who worked in the COVID-19 ICU, with reference to theory
(Morgeson et al., 2015).

Decreasing Perceived Novelty of COVID-19
Although COVID-19 is clearly a novel disease to the public, it is
not so new to us as medical professionals on the frontline in the
battle against COVID-19. As a leading hospital in southwestern
China, over the years we have accumulated rich experience and
expertise in the treatment of contagious diseases (e.g., SARS, inﬂuenza, and avian inﬂuenza), especially during winter and spring. As
we already know, the hospital has clear and effective rules, procedures, and guidelines to follow when a contagious disease occurs.
Thus, our medical staff are well aware of the sequence of steps they
should take to respond to COVID-19. We have also formed a special
committee to familiarize you with the latest developments in the
COVID-19 pandemic and address your related questions.

Decreasing Perceived Disruption of COVID-19
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our hospital has taken
meticulous measures and established comprehensive contingency
plans to minimize any disruptions caused by COVID-19. We also
have sufﬁcient PPE and other resources available to protect our
employees and avoid work interruptions. To date, there have been
no signiﬁcant disruptions to hospital operations or employees’ work.
None of the employees in our hospital have tested positive for the
coronavirus or reported that they cannot fulﬁll their job duties. The
leadership at all levels of our hospital will remain fully committed to

14

addressing your concerns and assisting you in overcoming any
disruptions to your work and life.

Decreasing Perceived Criticality of COVID-19
Effective medical procedures for lowering the chance of infection
and curing patients are being developed and implemented. The
current mortality rate of COVID-19 in China is far lower than that of
SARS in 2003. The number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19
nationwide has dropped signiﬁcantly, from 80,695 to 20,533, while
the number of patients in the Sichuan Province has decreased from
539 to 79 as of March 7, 2020. Clearly, the crisis will be under
control in the near future, as lockdown policies and effective testing
and treatment have led to a substantial reduction in daily new
COVID-19 cases in China.

Work Meaningfulness Intervention
In the letter to the COVID-19 ICU medical professionals, the vice
president of the participating hospital stressed the following key
points to promote work meaningfulness.

Fulﬁlling the Hospital’s Goal (Carton, 2018;
Rosso et al., 2010)
As a COVID-19 ICU health worker, you are making a signiﬁcant
contribution to the hospital’s goal of providing excellent medical
services under the current circumstances. Without your unwavering
contribution, our hospital would never have received so much
appreciation and recognition. Your talent and caring manner are
a credit to and pride of our hospital. Undoubtedly, our hospital’s
future development and success will continue to rely on your hard
work and dedication.

Facilitating Patients’ Well-Being and Health
(Frieder et al., 2018; Pratt & Ashforth, 2003)
You have given your utmost effort to take great care of
every patient and have demonstrated your exceptional medical
skills. Your compassion and humility are always impressive.
Our patients and their families are very grateful for the differences you have made in their lives. They call you and other
ICU health workers “angels sent by God on Earth” because
you have saved patients’ lives and preserved their health. Human
life is so invaluable that your work truly deserves such beautiful
praise!

Fostering Personal Growth and Development
(Lam et al., 2016; Robertson et al., 2020)
The French writer Sir Thomas Browne once said, “you
can’t extend the length of your life, but can grasp its width.”
Undoubtedly, as a COVID-19 frontline health worker, you are not
only providing great assistance to our hospital and patients, but are
also enriching your own life. Your work creates meaning and
purpose in life and fosters your personal growth and development.
Our colleagues who were involved in the treatment of
SARS patients found that they gained valuable experiences and
skills, which were extremely beneﬁcial to their later career
advancement. We look forward to seeing your continued success
and prosperity in the most honorable and esteemed profession in
the world!
