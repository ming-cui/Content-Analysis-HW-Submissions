In order to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has developed a list of recommended preventative health behaviors for Americans to enact,
including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and limiting nonessential trips from home. Drawing
upon scarcity theory, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the economic stressors of
perceived job insecurity and perceived financial insecurity are related to employee self-reports of
enacting such behaviors. Moreover, we tested propositions regarding the impact of two state-level
contextual variables that may moderate those relationships: the generosity of unemployment insurance
benefits and extensiveness of statewide COVID-19-related restrictions. Using a multilevel data set of
N ⫽ 745 currently employed U.S. workers nested within 43 states, we found that both job insecurity and
financial insecurity were negatively related to the enactment of the CDC-recommended guidelines.
However, the state-level variables acted as cross-level moderators, such that the negative relationship
between job insecurity and compliance with the CDC guidelines was attenuated within states that have
a more robust unemployment system. However, working in a state with more extensive COVID-19
restrictions seemed to primarily benefit more financially secure workers. When statewide policies were
more restrictive, employees reporting more financial security were more likely to enact the CDCrecommended guidelines compared to their financially insecure counterparts. We discuss these findings
in light of the continuing need to develop policies to address the public health crisis while also protecting
employees facing economic stressors.
Keywords: economic stressors, job insecurity, financial insecurity, COVID-19

Not surprisingly, given the unparalleled nature of these unfolding twin events, little is known regarding the interplay between
economic stressors (Probst, 2005), such as potential job loss and
financial insecurity, and the extent to which workers comply with
the CDC recommended guidelines to prevent catching or spreading the novel coronavirus (e.g., maintaining a physical distance of
at least 6 feet from others when out in public or at work, staying
home except to conduct essential tasks, disinfecting frequently
used items and high-touch surfaces, frequent handwashing for at
least 20 s, etc.). Drawing upon scarcity theory (Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, & Zhao, 2013; Mullainathan & Shafir, 2014), the first
aim of the current study was to develop and test hypotheses
regarding the relationship between two prevalent economic stressors (job insecurity and financial insecurity) and the enactment of
the CDC-recommended behaviors.
Scarcity theory (Mani et al., 2013; Mullainathan & Shafir, 2014)
posits that dealing with a perceived lack of valued resources (e.g.,
food, money, stable employment, or time) induces a scarcity
mind-set that consumes cognitive bandwidth, reduces optimal decision making, and depletes self-control due to intense focus on the
unmet need. Applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic, scarcity
theory would suggest that workers already coping with economic
stressors such as job insecurity or financial insecurity may have
even less bandwidth to devote to effectively responding to additional demands such as attending to behavioral recommendations
from public health officials, while simultaneously juggling other
new demands imposed by stay-at-home orders, recommendations

At the beginning of March 2020, unemployment in the United
States stood near a record low of 3.5% (Bureau of Labor Statistics,
2020). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (2020)
officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Within a mere 6
weeks, over 30 million workers had filed for unemployment,
representing nearly 19% of the U.S. labor force with millions more
worried that their jobs may be next (Tappe, 2020). Economists
project that the distancing measures recommended by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020)—required to
combat the spread of COVID-19 and protect the nation’s public
health—will come at a steep cost to workers with persistently high
unemployment rates coupled with a sharp decline in the nation’s
gross domestic product (Matthews, 2020). Thus, while facing an
unprecedented public health crisis, the short- and long-term economic ramifications are equally unlike anything the world has seen
in the past 100 years.

to purchase disinfecting supplies, stocking up on emergency supplies of groceries, and caring for children without school or daycare supports. According to scarcity research (e.g., Huijsmans et
al., 2019; Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012), individuals faced
with perceived scarcity simply have fewer resources to attend to
other demands due to attentional tunneling on the aspects of
perceived scarcity being experienced.
While scarcity theory may predict adverse effects on economically stressed workers, it may also provide clues to potential
remedies. Specifically, employees do not exist within a vacuum,
and their behavior can be shaped by the context in which they live
and work (Johns, 2006). Therefore, governmental policies that
alleviate the causes of perceived scarcity (e.g., insecure employment or financial strain) may restore some of the attentional
capacity that is drained by these conditions (Mani et al., 2013;
Mullainathan & Shafir, 2014); on the other hand, policies that
create additional burden may be potentially detrimental.
By mid-April 2020 (the time of our data collection), the United
States had seen large variability in how state governors enacted
COVID-19 policies directly affecting the lives of nearly every
worker within their states, ranging from no statewide stay-at-home
order (e.g., Iowa) to strict mandatory orders and required 14-day
quarantines for arriving travelers (e.g., Maine). Moreover, U.S.
states have ongoing broad latitude in shaping the social safety net
available to workers who lose their employment (e.g., level of
unemployment insurance benefits) during crises like the
COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the second aim of the current
study was to examine two state-level contextual variables as potential moderators of the relationship between economic stressors
and compliance with CDC recommendations, namely, the extensiveness of the statewide COVID-19-related restrictions and the
generosity of the unemployment insurance safety net available to
workers who do lose their jobs.
Below, we first discuss the nature of economic stressors and
briefly review the outcomes associated with these stressors. Next,
we develop predictions regarding the relationship between job
insecurity, financial insecurity, and the enactment of the CDCrecommended behaviors. Finally, we discuss how higher-level
(i.e., statewide) variables may attenuate or exacerbate these relationships. Figure 1 provides an overall summary of our study’s
hypotheses and the multilevel conceptual model tested.
Economic stressors refer to income- and employment-related
sources of stress (Probst, 2005) and include economic instability
(e.g., number and duration of periods of unemployment, downward mobility), economic deprivation (e.g., loss of income and
financial resources), employment uncertainty (e.g., job insecurity),
and economic strain (e.g., financial insecurity). While the first two
categories are typically considered more objective in nature, the
latter two categories reflect more subjective individual perceptions. Specifically, whereas job insecurity reflects a perceived
threat to the continuity and stability of one’s employment, financial insecurity reflects perceptions of inadequate funds to meet
one’s current needs and financial obligations (Probst, 2005).1
Decades of research demonstrates the numerous adverse negative
effects that these stressors can have on workers and their families,
including reduced physical and mental health, poorer long-term
career outcomes, and impaired marital, family, and social relationships (see meta-analyses by Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018; McKee-Ryan

& Harvey, 2011; McKee-Ryan, Song, Wanberg, & Kinicki, 2005;
Richardson, Elliott, & Roberts, 2013).
While the COVID-19 pandemic will likely lead to increases in
each of these sources of economic stress, some of them (e.g.,
downward mobility, periods and duration of unemployment) unfold over long periods and will only be able to be thoroughly
investigated over the course of the upcoming months and years.
Nevertheless, as described above, other forms of economic stressors (e.g., job insecurity and financial insecurity) are already
widespread. In addition to millions of newly unemployed and
those fearing future job loss, scenes of thousands of individuals
lining up at food banks across the country highlight the sharply
increased demand for basic essentials and hunger relief by an
estimated 17.1 million new people (Van Pykeren, 2020).
Unfortunately, prior research suggests that employees facing the
economic stressors of job insecurity (Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018) and
financial insecurity (Petitta, Probst, Barbaranelli, & Ghezzi, 2020)
are at higher risk of adverse health and safety-related outcomes at
work, with research finding these stressors are associated with
lower work-related safety compliance, as well as more subsequent
injuries and accidents (Probst, 2002). Other experimental and field
research has found that job insecurity was associated with reduced
performance on nonwork specific tasks such as Duncker’s (1945)
functional fixedness task and remote association tasks (Probst,
Stewart, Gruys, & Tierney, 2007). In line with scarcity theory,
such effects have largely been posited to be due to cognitive
overload and attentional tunneling (Wickens, 1996). In support of
this theoretical pathway, Probst, Chizh, Hu, Jiang, and Austin
(2019) found that cognitive failures operated as the mediating
mechanism between job insecurity and performance on a nonwork-related idea generation task.
In a like fashion, perceived scarcity due to job or financial
insecurity would be expected to negatively affect compliance with
CDC behavioral guidelines due to similar attentional tunneling and
cognitive overload mechanisms. In other words, individuals operating under a scarcity mind-set (i.e., those perceiving threats of
potential job loss or financial insecurity) may be less able to devote
additional scarce time, money. or attentional resources toward
meeting the CDC behavioral guidelines. Therefore, we predict the
following:
Hypothesis 1: Job insecurity will be negatively related to
compliance with CDC guidelines.
1
Although research (e.g., Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018) indicates there are
two distinct forms of job insecurity (cognitive vs. affective), we deliberately chose to focus on the cognitive aspects of both job insecurity and
financial insecurity for conceptual and methodological reasons. From a
conceptual standpoint, we were more interested in cognitive perceptions of
potential future job loss (rather than worry), which also corresponds better
with our cognitive (rather than affective) measure of financial insecurity
(i.e., inability to pay bills vs. anxiety associated with not being able to pay
bills). Moreover, cognitive measures of economic stress are theoretically
more aligned with the scarcity theory foundation for our hypothesized
effects (i.e., effects due to attentional tunneling and cognitive overload). It
is also important to recognize that financial insecurity, while typically
negatively correlated with income (e.g., Dijkstra-Kersten, BiesheuvelLeliefeld, van der Wouden, Penninx, & van Marwijk, 2015), can also be
affected by other financial variables such as student loans, car payments,
mortgages, credit card debt, and current savings.

Hypothesis 2: Financial insecurity will be negatively related to
compliance with CDC guidelines.
While we expect that these economic stressors will be predictive
of compliance with the CDC recommendations, numerous scholars
(e.g., Jiang, Probst, & Sinclair, 2013; Shoss & Probst, 2012;
Sinclair, Sears, Probst, & Zajack, 2010) have also argued that
employee reactions to economic stressors are impacted by the
larger economic, social, and cultural system in which a person is
embedded (ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012). This can include
public policies, the economic standing of a population, social
equality, wealth, and other sociocultural elements that affect the
context within which one operates. In the current study, we focused on contextual variables at the state level. While the federal
government has provided guidance from the CDC on recommended behaviors to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, the
methods for how best to facilitate these behaviors have been
largely left to state governors who have, in turn, implemented a
variety of different approaches. Moreover, critical aspects of the
social safety net central to our study vary at the state level rather
than other potential levels of interest (e.g., city or county levels).
In particular, we selected two state-level contextual variables that,
based on the available empirical evidence, would be salient in
influencing the extent to which economic stressors may result in
less adherence to the CDC guidelines.
The first is the robustness of the social safety net available to
those who become laid off, operationalized as the average weekly
unemployment benefits. Prior research conducted at the country
level (Debus, Probst, König, & Kleinmann, 2012) found that the
relationship between job insecurity and adverse outcomes is attenuated among workers who live in countries with more generous
social safety nets. We expect that a similar effect at the state level
will be found for the relationship between job insecurity and the
enactment of the CDC-recommended behaviors. Specifically,
workers in states that have a more generous unemployment insurance benefit will be less likely to react to a potential loss of one’s
job by compromising their enactment of the CDC-recommended
behaviors. Knowing that one has access to more generous statelevel resources in the event of job loss might alleviate perceived
scarcity and restore some of the attentional demand resources

needed to focus on enacting the CDC guidelines. On the other
hand, we do not expect that such a relationship would hold for
perceived financial insecurity since unemployment insurance benefits are only available to individuals who become unemployed
(i.e., a salient safety net for individuals who perceive a threat to
their employment); on the other hand, such benefits are not available to people who lack financial resources (but may have a secure
job).2 Therefore, we predict the following:
Hypothesis 3: State-level generosity of unemployment insurance benefits will attenuate the relationship between job insecurity and compliance with CDC guidelines.
The second relevant state-level contextual variable was the
extensiveness of the statewide COVID-19-related restrictions. According to the National Governors Association (2020), there have
been numerous policies and orders put into place to stem the tide
of coronavirus infections, including travel restrictions, limits on
gatherings, stay-at-home orders, school closures, and closure of
nonessential businesses, among others. Yet, states have varied
widely in the extent to which they have enacted these policies, with
some introducing multiple policies coupled with strict enforcement
and others offering fewer strategies with or without enforcement.
While such societal-level supports can be protective (ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012) and serve as normative cues for employees and their organizations, they may also serve as a double-edged
sword for employees operating under economic stress by imposing
additional burdens. For example, more numerous state-level restrictions could result in more disruptions to business operations,
temporary business closures, and a negative business outlook.
Such conditions could further compound the scarcity mind-set
experienced by job-insecure employees. We expect similar effects
regarding how such restrictions may affect financially insecure
workers. Even prior to the pandemic, over half of American
2
In a similar fashion, we do not anticipate any main effects of the level
of unemployment benefits on enactment of the CDC guidelines, since we
argue that the effects of this social safety net would only be applicable to
individuals specifically experiencing perceived scarcity due to potential job
loss.

households reported lacking sufficient funds in case of an emergency (JPMorgan Chase & Co. Institute, 2019; The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2015). Yet, adhering to the recommended CDC guidelines while under additional imposed state-level imposed
restrictions requires even more attentional and financial resources
from workers (e.g., emergency funds to stock up groceries and
essential goods, caring for children without daycare supports,
assisting with children’s online schooling).
Thus, insecure workers may demonstrate even less adherence to
the CDC behavioral guidelines when operating under conditions of
increased state-imposed COVID-19 demands. On the other hand,
financially secure and job-secure individuals living in states with
more extensive COVID-19-related state restrictions may have
more resources to better comply with such recommendations and,
therefore, may be expected to demonstrate the highest level of
benefit from these policies, that is, show the highest levels of
compliance with the CDC guidelines. Indeed, early analyses of cell
phone location data (Valentino-DeVries, Lu, & Dance, 2020)
conducted during the first month of the pandemic as states moved
into lockdown suggest that individuals in economically well-off
areas appeared to be better able to stay home, whereas lowerincome areas showed more travel away from home.
Based on this, we expect that more extensive statewide restrictions will be associated with more adherence to the CDC guidelines but that this will be observed among those who self-report
higher levels of perceived financial and job security compared to
their less secure counterparts. Therefore, we predict the following:
Hypothesis 4: The extensiveness of state-level COVID-19
restrictions will exacerbate the relationship between job insecurity and compliance with CDC guidelines.
Hypothesis 5: The extensiveness of state-level COVID-19
restrictions will exacerbate the relationship between financial
insecurity and compliance with CDC guidelines.

Method
Participants and Procedure
Our individual-level data came from an ongoing study on the
workforce-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, entitled
“Longitudinal Study of Work/Life Experiences During the
COVID-19 Pandemic” (classified as exempt by the Washington
State University Institutional Review Board; Protocol 18240); this
is the first publication from that broader data collection effort.
Anonymous online survey data were collected from U.S.-based
Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers in April 2020. In order to
qualify to participate, respondents must have been working at least
20 hr per week outside of the MTurk platform and indicate that
they had a supervisor at work. Moreover, as recommended by
Peer, Vosgerau, and Acquisti (2014), we only recruited “highreputation” participants with a current approval rating on MTurk
of 90% or greater coupled with completion of at least 100 prior
tasks on MTurk.
A total of N ⫽ 788 MTurk workers qualified and received $2 in
compensation. After excluding (a) participants who missed two or
more attention checks out of four total, (b) those who did not finish
the survey, (c) those belonging to states with fewer than three

respondents in our survey, and (d) those with a missing value on
any of the predictors, the final sample comprised 745 participants
nested within 43 states.3 The average number of respondents per
state was 25.17 (SD ⫽ 15.56; range 3–98). The majority of
participants were male (62%), White (69%), and college graduates
(68%). A total of 57% of participants were married or living with
a partner. The mean age was 37.99 (SD ⫽ 10.93). The average
hours worked per week was 41.23 (SD ⫽ 8.01), and 30% reported
currently working onsite. The median reported 2019 household
income fell within the range from $50,000 to $59,999. Twenty
industrial sectors were represented with the five most common
being professional/scientific/technical services (14%), finance/insurance (12%), retail (11%), health care/social assistance (9%),
and manufacturing (8%).

Measures
Individual-level variables. Perceived job insecurity was
measured using the nine-item Job Security Index (JSI; Probst,
2003). Using a scoring system validated by Hanisch (1992), participants were asked to indicate whether each phrase (e.g., “uncertain”) described their future employment on a scale from no (0),
“?” (2), to yes (3). Positively phrased items were reverse-coded,
such that higher numbers reflect greater perceived insecurity.
Petitta et al.’s (2020) four-item scale was used to measure
perceived financial insecurity. Using a 5-point scale (1 ⫽ never to
5 ⫽ always), respondents indicated the extent to which they
perceive difficulty in fulfilling their financial responsibilities. Responses were scored so that higher numbers reflect greater perceived financial insecurity.
Compliance with CDC guidelines was measured with six items
that were developed for this study based on the CDC guidelines to
prevent the spread of COVID-19 (CDC, 2020). Respondents were
asked to indicate how often they were currently enacting the
recommended behaviors on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
See Appendix A for items.
The following control variables were also included. Per capita
income was computed as the ratio of self-reported total household
income bracket (1: less than $10,000 to 12: $150,000 or more) to
the number of household members. Education was measured as the
highest degree earned. Minority status was dummy-coded (0:
3
To confirm if our final sample was representative of the population of
individuals living within those 43 states, we conducted correlation analyses
between our sample statistics and population parameters based on data
from the U.S. Census Bureau with respect to the number of state residents
(r ⫽ .98, p ⬍ .001), as well as the percentage of White (r ⫽ .52, p ⬍ 001)
and Hispanic residents (r ⫽ .56, p ⬍ .001). Both analyses indicate a
reasonable degree of representativeness at least in terms of population size,
race, and ethnicity. Additionally, we tested whether the states that we
excluded due to low within-state sample sizes (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, plus Washington, DC)
differed significantly on any of the state-level variables of interest (i.e.,
COVID-19 restrictions and unemployment insurance benefits), plus additional possible factors, including state population, COVID-19 cases, per
capita cases, and per capita deaths at the time of data collection, as well as
political lean as measured by the percentage of Trump voters in 2016. None
of these were significant, other than population, F(1, 47) ⫽ 4.30, p ⫽ .04,
suggesting—as one might expect—that states with smaller populations
(M ⫽ 980,908) were more likely to be dropped from the analysis due to
proportionately smaller numbers of individuals being sampled from those
states, compared to larger population states (M ⫽ 7,463,290).

Caucasian; 1: minority). Remote working arrangement was also
dummy-coded (0: onsite; 1: remote workers).4
State-level variables. Unemployment benefits were operationalized as the average weekly benefit amount provided to recipients in each state, based on data retrieved from the Department
of Labor (2019) for the most recently available quarter. It was
calculated by dividing the total benefits paid during unemployment
by the number of weeks compensated for unemployment. The
average weekly unemployment benefits amount was $359.88
(SD ⫽ $83.33; observed range $213–$555). For our analysis, we
expressed these data in $100s.
Data regarding the COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time of
our data collection were drawn from the National Governors
Association website, which provides a Coronavirus State Action
Tracking Chart (National Governors Association, 2020). Eight
policies that were considered most relevant to state residents were
selected out of a variety of tracked policies. These included limits
on gatherings, school closures, closure of nonessential businesses,
mobilization of the National Guard, state employee travel restrictions, domestic travel restrictions, curfews, and recommended
mask usage. Policies were coded on a 0 to 1 scale (to equally
weight each policy) and then summed for each state, such that
higher numbers are reflective of more COVID-19 restrictions in
place. The mean score was 5.84 (SD ⫽ 0.96, observed range:
3.67– 8). See Appendix B for a complete listing of the policies and
coding schema.

showed the average unbiased estimate of the Level 1 relationships.
As expected, higher levels of both job insecurity and financial
insecurity were associated with significantly lower compliance
with the CDC guidelines (b ⫽ ⫺0.06, p ⫽ .01; b ⫽ ⫺0.17, p ⬍
.001, respectively). Additionally, employees who were working
from home reported higher levels of enactment of CDCrecommended behaviors (b ⫽ .17, p ⫽ .001).6 Hence, Hypotheses
1 and 2 were supported. Model 2 added the state-level predictors
of the adjusted group compliance means, which were both nonsignificant.
The cross-level interactions were specified in Model 3. As
hypothesized, we found that the generosity of unemployment
benefits at the state level significantly attenuated the relationship
between individual job insecurity and compliance with CDC
guidelines (b ⫽ 0.08, p ⫽ .003). The cross-level effect of the
COVID-19 restrictions on the job insecurity– compliance relationship was not significant (b ⫽ 0.05, p ⫽ .12). However, COVID-19
restrictions at the state level significantly exacerbated the relationship between individual financial insecurity and individual compliance with CDC guidelines (b ⫽ ⫺0.13, p ⫽ .001). Thus,
Hypotheses 3 and 5 were supported while Hypothesis 4 was not.
Although we did not make any specific hypotheses on the crosslevel effect of unemployment benefits on the financial insecurity–
compliance to CDC guidelines relationship, it was included in the
model for completeness. This cross-level interaction was not significant (b ⫽ ⫺0.02, p ⫽ .71).7

Results
Before testing the hypothesized multilevel model, we ran several preliminary checks. None of the items approached 3.0 in
skewness and 10.0 in kurtosis, supporting normality assumptions
(Kline, 2015). Subsequently, we ran a confirmatory factor analysis
to assess the measurement model using the weighted least square
mean and variance adjusted estimator, also accounting for the
nesting of the data. The factorial structure showed good fit to the
data: ␹2(149) ⫽ 463.61, CFI ⫽ .99, TLI ⫽ .99, RMSEA ⫽ .05,
SRMR ⫽ .06. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics and correlations at the individual and state levels. At the individual level, job
insecurity and financial insecurity were both negatively correlated
with enactment of the CDC guidelines and positively correlated
with each other.
We tested our model using only observed variables with MPlus
8.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998 –2017). Since we compared nested
models, parameters and standard errors were estimated using the
full-information maximum likelihood estimator. The individuallevel predictors were group mean centered and the state-level
predictors were grand mean centered (Enders & Tofighi, 2007).
The intraclass correlation coefficient was quite low (.02), signifying that there was not a considerable amount of variance in the
outcome attributable to clustering (Bliese, 2000).5 However, research has shown that it is possible to find significant cross-level
effects even when the proportion of variance at the between level
appears to be low (Bliese, Maltarich, & Hendricks, 2018; Snijders
& Bosker, 1999).
Three models were compared: (a) a random intercept fixed slope
model, (b) a random intercept random slope model, and (c) a
random intercept random slope model with the cross-level interactions. Parameter estimates are presented in Table 2. Model 1

While conceptually distinct from perceived financial insecurity, income may nevertheless be considered a plausible alternative explanation
for any observed effects since higher income may facilitate greater compliance with CDC guidelines. Education may impact compliance with CDC
guidelines, given that research has demonstrated that health behaviors are
correlated with educational attainment (Skalamera & Hummer, 2016).
Likewise, racial and ethical minorities are more likely to be impacted by
the negative effects of COVID-19 (Chowkwanyun & Reed, 2020), and
remote workers may have more control over the enactment of CDCrecommended behaviors.
5
Although variance in the outcome due to clustering is arguably low, we
retained our multilevel approach in order to model each variable at its
appropriate empirical and conceptual level of analysis. However, upon
reviewer recommendation, we did run a model in which all the state-level
variables were disaggregated to the individual level. As expected, these
results substantially confirmed our multilevel results. Moreover, comporting with previous simulation studies (see e.g., Finch & French, 2011),
standard errors in the single-level model were slightly underestimated. Full
results are available from the first author.
6
We recognize that among the CDC-recommended behaviors, some
may be arguably more versus less under the direct personal control of
individuals working onsite (e.g., covering one’s cough vs. maintenance of
physical distancing). In order to rule this out as an explanation, we
conducted a supplementary analysis, replicating the random intercepts
random slopes model with cross-level interactions presented in Table 2
with two different sets of outcomes. The first was made up of CDCrecommended behaviors that may potentially be impacted by variables
outside of the employees’ own control (i.e., Items 1– 4 in Appendix A)
while the second contained the behaviors that are arguably more under the
control of employees (i.e., Items 5 and 6 in Appendix A). Results of these
alternative models comported with those presented in Table 2, further
comporting with predictions grounded in scarcity theory. Full results are
available from the first author.
7
Upon reviewer recommendation, we also tested whether the relationship between income and compliance with CDC guidelines was moderated
by state-level COVID-19-related restrictions. However, this was nonsignificant (b ⫽ 0.00, p ⫽ .94).

Figures 2 and 3 graphically depict the cross-level interactions.
The plots show that more generous unemployment benefits at the
state level attenuate the negative relationship between job insecurity and compliance with CDC guidelines (see Figure 2). Specifically, within a state context of more robust unemployment benefits, job insecurity was unrelated to compliance with CDC
guidelines. However, workers in states with lower unemployment
benefits showed decreasing compliance as job insecurity increased. On the other hand, more extensive COVID-19-related
state restrictions exacerbated the negative relationship between
financial insecurity and compliance with CDC guidelines (see
Figure 3). Specifically, in states with fewer restrictions in place,
compliance was low regardless of perceived financial insecurity,
whereas in states with more restrictions in place, the financially
more secure respondents reported greater compliance with CDC
guidelines compared to their less financially secure counterparts.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic not only represents the most severe
public health crisis in the past 100 years but also has led to
dramatic increases in unemployment rates, disruptions to normal
business operations, reduced work hours and/or temporary furloughs, and heightened demands for food assistance. With persistently high numbers of daily cases, such impacts on the job and
financial security of individuals are likely to continue to be felt
until the virus can be contained either through restrictive public
health measures or the development of a vaccine.
The first aim of our study was to examine the interplay between
these economic stressors and enactment of the CDC behavioral
recommendations meant to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Our
findings demonstrate that subjective psychological economic stressors play a role in predicting the extent to which workers comply
with the recommended guidelines above and beyond other objective socioeconomic indicators such as income level or educational
attainment, as well as whether employees are currently working
onsite or from home. Although employees working onsite reported
less compliance with the CDC recommendations (a concern in and

of itself), we found that workers with greater job insecurity and
perceived financial insecurity were also less likely to enact the
CDC recommendations. These findings comport with scarcity
theory and earlier research on the effects of job insecurity and
financial scarcity, suggesting that workers facing financial or job
insecurity stressors may experience attentional tunneling or cognitive overload, leading to less focus on attending to off-task
demands such as enactment of the new CDC COVID-19 prevention guidelines.
However, we also found that state-level contextual variables can
influence the strength and direction of these relationships. For
example, our findings indicate that job insecurity was unrelated to
compliance with the COVID-19 preventative recommendations
when working in a state with a more robust social safety net (i.e.,
more generous unemployment insurance benefits). However, these
protective benefits do not extend to those who are experiencing
financial insecurity. This may be because the availability of unemployment insurance benefits only becomes relevant in the event
of job loss; thus, a more generous unemployment insurance benefit
will not necessarily alleviate the scarcity felt by individuals facing
financial strains or operate as a main effect to influence the
health-related behaviors of individuals within the state.
On the other hand, it appears that financially secure workers are
the ones who most benefit from being in a state with more
extensive COVID-19 restrictions in place. Such individuals perhaps have the means to stay home and enact social distancing
behaviors in response to state recommendations, whereas the financially insecure have less latitude to do so. Indeed, levels of
enacting the recommended CDC behaviors were low among the
financially insecure respondents regardless of their state-level policies.
Such findings have implications for policymakers at the state
and federal levels. While many companies do not have the cash
reserves needed to maintain payroll while their workers are under
stay-at-home orders, layoffs do not always need to be the answer.
Indeed, policymakers in many countries have developed creative
solutions that are particularly apt for this unique event, such as

wage replacement grants to businesses that retain their workers. In
doing so, employees can maintain needed financial and job security, potentially alleviating the effects of a scarcity mind-set.
Moreover, businesses can avoid the costly process of laying off
only to later seek and rehire qualified employees. Yet, such policies need not be unique to the current pandemic but could also be
applied to future economic recessions regardless of the precipitating cause. Indeed, previous research has shown that employees in
societies with generous social safety nets suffer fewer adverse
consequences of economic stressors such as job insecurity (e.g.,
Debus et al., 2012).
While the government provided fast and direct economic assistance (e.g., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act) to help workers and small businesses during the early pandemic, experts indicate these solutions are unlikely to address the
ongoing financial needs of U.S. residents in the long term (Enda,
Gale, & Haldeman, 2020). Yet, economic projections indicate that
direct cash into low-income and recently unemployed households
is among the most effective stimulus mechanisms to the economy
(Arnon, He, & Huntley, 2020). Thus, while such policies make
sense from an economic standpoint, our data indicate lessening
economic stressors experienced by U.S. workers, and bolstering
the social safety net may also have public health benefits by
improving adherence to the CDC preventative health guidelines.
Future research might also consider whether such effects extend
more broadly to other health promotion behaviors (e.g., physical
activity, nutrition) via an alleviation of the scarcity mind-set.

While the current findings are thought-provoking in that they
suggest a potential link between prevalent economic stressors and
health behaviors such as adherence to the COVID-19 prevention
guidelines, there are numerous caveats to consider as well as
needed future research. First, our data are cross-sectional (albeit
multilevel). Thus, future longitudinal data preferably gathered over
multiple waves are needed to temporally separate the economic
stressors and state-level policies of interest from the behavioral
outcomes and better ascertain the direction and trajectories of any
causal relationships.
Moreover, due to the use of a convenience sample, we cannot
claim to have a nationally representative sample and thus must be
cautious about the ability to generalize our findings to the entire
U.S. workforce. For example, our sample was highly educated
(68% reporting a college degree or higher compared to 35% in the
population). Moreover, all had jobs in mid-April at the time of our
initial recruitment, which by definition would have excluded any
of the millions who had already lost their jobs due to the pandemic.
On the other hand, our sample was slightly more diverse (31%
non-White) than the U.S. population (23.5%). The percentage of
respondents who were married or cohabiting (57%) was similar to
the population (60%). Finally, our sample reported a slightly lower
median household income ($50,000 –$59,999) compared to the
U.S. median of $60,293.
We also acknowledge that our effect sizes are small. However,
in light of the highly infectious nature and rapid spread of the
coronavirus, early simulation research (Matrajt & Leung, 2020)

suggests that even a modest 25% reduction in social contacts
among adults can result in 47% fewer cases and over 90% fewer
deaths compared to no intervention at the epidemic peak for adults.
Thus, even small effects on adherence to the CDC guidelines can
be of practical significance within this context.
Another drawback to the current study was our lack of a measure of essential worker status and the fact that the majority of our
sample was currently working from home. Therefore, we could not
evaluate the effects of specific workplace conditions (e.g., supervisor support, organizational safety climate, work-related resources facilitating or inhibiting compliance with CDC guidelines)
as additional drivers of employee compliance with the CDC guidelines. While scarcity theory and cognitive overload mechanisms
may explain the observed relationships in our study, other potential
work-specific mediating or moderating mechanisms (e.g., fears of
workplace retaliation such as job loss or reduced work hours in
response to requests for adequate personal protective equipment,
sick leave) should be explored particularly as greater numbers of
employees return to onsite work as states reopen.
Additionally, although we conceptualized and measured job
insecurity as a cognitive perception of the continuity and stability
of one’s employment (Probst, 2003), research has found that
affective job insecurity is also relevant in understanding strain
processes (Jiang & Lavaysse, 2018; see also Footnote 1). Therefore, future research should investigate whether and how the
currently examined relationships might differ using more affectively laden measures of job and financial insecurity (i.e., anxiety/
fears regarding potential job loss and financial situation, rather
than cognitive perceptions of potential job loss or financial inadequacy).
Finally, the current study only examined preventative behaviors
in response to the individual-level economic stressors and the
state-level policies. Future research should examine the extent to
which such variables also result in differential exposure to the
coronavirus and development of COVID-19 illness among employees, coworkers, and their household members.

Despite these limitations, this study highlights the impact of
prevalent economic stressors on important health-related behaviors, as well as the importance of state-level policies from both
psychological and public health perspectives during the concurrent
COVID-19 and economic crises. While the impact of state- and
national-level policies has been extensively studied within public
health domains, the impact of such distal policies on the behavior
of individual workers has been less investigated within organizational psychology. Our findings emphasize the continuing need to
develop policies and interventions to address both crises while
recognizing their sometimes differential effects on the behavior of
economically stressed employees.

Appendix B
State-Level COVID-19 Restrictions From the Coronavirus State Action Tracking Chart

This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.
This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.

The following represent the eight actions and policies included
in our operationalization of the state-level COVID-19 restrictions.
These were selected due to their greatest potential impact on the
daily activities of workers. The level of implementation described
in the National Governors Association tracking chart (National
Governors Association, 2020) was coded to range from 0 to 1, so
that each policy would be equally weighted in the overall state
policy composite.
1.

Limits on gatherings: 0 ⫽ no limits; .5 ⫽ recommendation
only or bans on gatherings ⬎ 10; 1 ⫽ ban on all gatherings

2.

School closures: 0 ⫽ no; 1 ⫽ yes

3.

Closure of nonessential businesses: 0 ⫽ no closures; .33 ⫽
restricted operations; .67 ⫽ some mandatory closures; 1 ⫽
all nonessential businesses closed

4.

Activation of the National Guard: 0 ⫽ no; 1 ⫽ yes

5.

State employee travel restrictions: 0 ⫽ no; 1 ⫽ yes

6.

Domestic travel limitations: 0 ⫽ no restrictions; .5 ⫽ recommended restrictions; 1 ⫽ executive order requiring travel
restrictions

7.

Curfew: 0 ⫽ no; 1 ⫽ yes

8.

Statewide mask policy: 0 ⫽ none; 1 ⫽ recommended mask
wearing (Note: None had mandates at the time of data
collection)

Additional policies were provided in the tracker but excluded
from our operationalization. Specifically, major disaster declaration was excluded because all states either already had such
declarations or were in the process of getting their application for
such declaration approved. Emergency declaration was excluded
for the same reason. Essential business designations indicated
whether states had defined what constituted an essential business,
but their criteria and industries could vary greatly from state to
state and, therefore, were not suitable for comparison. Extension of
state income tax filing deadlines, 1135 waiver status, movement of
primary election, and ventilator sharing were considered to have
no or limited impact on individual workers’ social distancing or
hygiene behaviors. Closure of some or all nonessential businesses
was excluded due to its high degree of redundancy with the
separately provided indicator of “closure of nonessential businesses.”
