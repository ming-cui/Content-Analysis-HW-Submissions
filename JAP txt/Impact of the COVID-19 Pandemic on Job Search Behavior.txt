This study examines how job search behavior changed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
weeks following the event’s onset, and if the physical contact required by different jobs moderated these
trends. Based on event system theory, we argue that the onset of the pandemic created a strong event
because it was highly novel, disruptive, and critical. We test this by examining 16 weeks of job
applications for 14 organizations that differ in terms of whether the jobs require employees to work from
home or face-to-face. We use Bliese, Adler, and Flynn’s (2017) transition framework and discontinuous
random coefficient growth curve modeling to test the pandemic’s effect on job search behavior both
during the event onset and then the weeks following the onset. Importantly, we include a 9-week preonset
baseline period to provide more rigorous tests of change. Results show that the onset of the pandemic
created an immediate increase in job search behavior (job applications), and this effect endured into the
postonset period. Job type moderated these trends, such that the onset and postonset applications were
substantially greater for work-from-home jobs (which followed a negatively accelerated curve) compared
to face-to-face jobs. These findings advance the job search literature by introducing event system theory
and transition frameworks to better understand how and why events uniquely influence job search
behavior over time.

In their comprehensive review of the job search literature,
Wanberg, Ali, and Csillag (2020) noted that more research on
context (macroeconomic conditions) is needed to provide “deeper
and richer insight into the predictors and moderators involved in
job search success” (p. 329). Toward this end, the goal of this
article is to test whether the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
changed job search behavior (i.e., job applications) over time and,
in doing so, advance a broader understanding of events and transitions in job search. First, we integrate event system theory
(Morgeson, Mitchell, & Liu, 2015) with the job search literature to
better understand and conceptualize how macro events, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, affect job search behavior. Compared to
other macro events such as recessions or stock market changes, the
pandemic’s onset is a macro event of higher novelty, disruption,
and criticality. Second, we apply frameworks for studying transitions (Bliese & Lang, 2016; Lang & Bliese, 2009) to distinguish
between the transition created at the onset of COVID-19 from the
postonset slope. As such, we focus specifically on how the pandemic led to a transition (Bliese et al., 2017) and produced an
immediate change in job applications across organizations. The
immediate onset period has not been examined in prior job search
research, which has instead emphasized the study of processes
after an event’s occurrence (e.g., job search following job loss).
Such an omission is problematic because the immediate conse-

The COVID-19 pandemic is producing unprecedented global
health and economic disruptions. Workers and organizations alike
are struggling to adapt to “the new normal” (Alter & Villa, 2020;
Mull, 2020; Solomon, 2020). Currently, there is more opinion than
evidence, especially in terms of understanding how the pandemic
is influencing worker preferences. A small but important literature
has shown that large-scale macro events (e.g., recessions) can
shape jobseeker perceptions (see Bianchi, 2020). However, even
this research has focused on reactions to macro events after they
occur, rather than understanding the transition created by the
introduction of an acute event (Bliese, Adler, & Flynn., 2017).
This is especially true for macro events that are unexpected or
difficult to predict. Consequently, little is known about how the

quences of an event may differ from effects later in time (Bliese et
al., 2017). We disentangle the effects of the event onset on job
search behavior from the more commonly studied postevent period
to better understand the full consequences of an event. Finally, we
theorize that the financial and health-related consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic affect the type of jobs to which applicants
apply. We show that the onset of the pandemic produces a sizable
shift in job search behavior toward jobs that require less physical
contact, and this effect is maintained in subsequent weeks following the onset. The introduction of event system theory into the job
search literature, along with the transition modeling framework,
offers new ways to theorize and model the impact that events have
on job search processes that can be adopted in future research, thus
providing implications that endure beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also have implications for practice, particularly in terms of whether there is value in offering work-fromhome opportunities and for understanding the consequences of
macro events more generally.
Importantly, we use a longitudinal methodology (discontinuous
random coefficient growth curve models [DRCGCM]; Lang &
Bliese, 2009; Singer & Willett, 2003) that enables a rigorous test
of the effects of the pandemic’s onset on job search behavior.
Examining the immediate transition caused by the COVID-19
onset event can only be accurately performed when there is a
sufficiently long baseline period to observe before the event
(Bliese et al., 2017). This study employs a baseline of 9 weeks
prior to the pandemic’s onset and 6 weeks following the pandemic’s onset. DRCGCM leverages these data in a way that enables the
decomposition of variance in job applications to preonset,
COVID-19 onset, and postonset periods. Therefore, the models
test the strength of the pandemic’s effect on the onset and postonset duration, relative to prepandemic levels.

Theoretical Foundation
Job search involves psychological processes, behaviors, and
contexts surrounding an individual’s attempt to find and get a
job. Prior research has focused primarily on understanding
either individual difference predictors of search activities and
outcomes or interventions aimed to enhance job search outcomes (e.g., Kanfer, Wanberg, & Kantrowitz, 2001; Klehe &
van Hooft, 2018; Liu, Huang, & Wang, 2014). In contrast, much
less research has examined the macro events that shape the
manifestation and experience of job search (Wanberg, Ali, et
al., 2020). Here, the focus is not on enduring macro conditions
(e.g., slowly changing economic conditions) but rather on
events that originate at broad economic levels and simultaneously influence multiple organizations and individuals. Event
system theory (Morgeson et al., 2015) helps understand the
nature of such macro events and when they shape individual and
collective responses but, to our knowledge, has not been used to
understand macro effects on job search.
Event system theory defines events as “discrete and bounded in
space and time” (Morgeson et al., 2015, p. 516). Events differ in
their strength and thus lie on a continuum from weak to strong.
Events that are more novel (different from prior routines), disruptive (magnitude of change), and critical (demand attention and
reprioritization) have stronger influences on outcomes. Events that
originate at higher (macro) levels also have broader impact and are
more enduring. A macro event has a beginning (i.e., onset) and
thus the event creates a temporally defined transition period between the introduction of the event and the start of a posttransition
period (Bliese et al., 2017). Figure 1 provides an illustration of
these distinct periods (the figure juxtaposes Bliese et al.’s framework with the pandemic event of interest in this study). The
transition period has a specific start and end, but the posttransition

COVID-19: EFFECTS ON JOB SEARCH

consequences of the event can endure and change over time.
Therefore, it is critical to ensure there are a sufficient number of
opportunities to observe behavior before and after the transition
period. Indeed, Bliese et al. (2017) note that “studies that attempt
to determine responses to events or postevent recovery trajectories
without . . . [preevent] . . . data are remarkably difficult to
interpret” (p. 274).
The introduction of a stronger macro event can thus produce
both immediate and long-term changes to behavior, and the effects
of predictors may change across these periods. The Great Recession offers one example. This macro event created a period of
strong disruption with distinct periods of transition and postrecession recovery, with predictive relationships changing across event
onset and postonset periods (e.g., Kim & Ployhart, 2014).
Unfortunately, prior job search research has not adopted such
models when examining macro events. As a consequence, prior
research has not been able to precisely estimate the variance
specific to macro events and their transition periods or disentangle
the variance between an event’s onset and postonset responses. For
example, research has examined the effects of unemployment or
job loss events influencing job search (Boswell, Zimmerman, &
Swider, 2012; Wanberg, Basbug, van Hooft, & Samtani, 2012).
However, this research tends to emphasize postevent reactions,
rather than study the transition caused by the event itself. In this
sense, there is some understanding of how macro events shape
responses after the event is introduced but not research on the
experience of the event’s introduction (an omission of research
more generally; see Bliese et al., 2017; Morgeson et al., 2015).
Thus, the field lacks a clear understanding of how macro events
produce change in job search behavior, both at the event’s onset
and subsequently over time.
This is not a criticism of prior research (or the researchers) but
rather recognition of the difficulty in studying macro events.
Besides the usual challenges associated with collecting longitudinal data, the use of DRCGCM carries additional requirements,
such as at least six measurement occasions, at least three measurement occasions before the event onset, and an ability to capture the
event’s introduction to define the transition period (Bliese et al.,
2017; Bliese & Lang, 2016). Such requirements are even more
daunting when trying to estimate rare and/or unexpected macro
events (e.g., terrorist attacks), as preevent baseline data and event
transition data are usually lacking (Bliese et al., 2017).
However, we are able to theorize and test such effects in this
study. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a particularly strong
macro event because it occurs at a high level (i.e., at the global
omnibus level) and is higher in novelty, disruption, and criticality
than most macro events, as predicted by event system theory
(Morgeson et al., 2015). First, the last event similar to the
COVID-19 pandemic was the 1918 flu epidemic; thus, it is highly
novel. Second, the pandemic is extremely disruptive as it led entire
countries to shut down their businesses, prohibited most travel, and
resulted in stay-at-home orders across the nation almost immediately. Third, the pandemic is critical in the sense that it has both
financial implications and health consequences. Morgeson et al.
(2015) note, “The more critical the event, the more likely it will be
seen as salient and require unusual attention and action” (p. 521).
Therefore, criticality is particularly important for determining
which behaviors are most likely to be affected by an event. In the
case of the pandemic, we argue that actions that influence financial

1209

well-being and physical health are relevant to employment; thus,
this event is likely to influence job search.
When viewed from event system theory, it is clear that the
COVID-19 pandemic is similar to, but stronger than, purely economic macro events like recessions. First, recessions are less novel
as they occur with some frequency (about every 5– 6 years),
whereas the COVID-19 pandemic was introduced quickly and
unexpectedly. Second, recessions can be reasonably well predicted
and tend to be introduced more gradually; thus, recession effects
are more likely to unfold over time, and the immediate disruption
is usually minimal. Third, while recessions have health consequences in that people may lose access to health care, the
COVID-19 pandemic has direct health consequences in terms of
hospitalization or death. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic represents
a particularly strong macro event. This fact, combined with the
understanding that most prior research on macro events has not
examined the immediate effects of an event (i.e., at onset), suggests there is much to learn about how the COVID-19 pandemic
may shape job search behavior and how such macro events influence job search more generally.

Context and Hypotheses
Based on job search theory and research (Bianchi, 2020; Wanberg, Ali, et al., 2020) and informed by event system theory
(Morgeson et al., 2015), we first consider the extent to which
recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic changed job search behavior during the transition period immediately following the
event. Event system theory suggests that events originating at a
higher level (i.e., omnibus context; Johns, 2006, 2017) are likely to
influence behavior across a wider range of contexts. Further, as
explained above, the pandemic has higher event strength (i.e.,
higher novelty, disruptiveness, and criticality; Morgeson et al.,
2015) than other macro events and thus should produce immediate
consequences. The question then becomes, how will job search
behavior change as a result of this strong and far-reaching event?
We posit that research examining job search during economic
recessions provides some clues. Bianchi (2020) notes that “recessions provoke uncertainty and a loss of control” (p. 121). Individuals tend to respond to such threats by seeking to regain control,
and one way this can be accomplished is by proactively applying
to new jobs (Bianchi, 2013; Porter et al., 2019; Wanberg, Ali, et
al., 2020; Wanberg et al., 2012). Thus, job search research supports the inference that applications will increase under conditions
of uncertainty and stress because job search offers a means to cope
with these stressors, particularly in the short term (Trope & Liberman, 2010; Wanberg, Kanfer, & Rotundo, 1999).
March 11, 2020, is the day COVID-19 was officially recognized
as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (2020). On
this day, the National Basketball Association also officially postponed its season and the U.S. president banned travel from Europe.
Further, the response to this event was almost immediate, with
business and school closures occurring that same day in many
areas of the United States. Therefore, in this study, we examine
preonset (baseline) job search as the weeks before March 11 and
postonset job search as the weeks following March 11. The onset
is the transition period during the week that includes March 11.
Given the pandemic’s strength (and, in particular, the immediate

1210

and severe disruption), the onset period should show a large
immediate increase in job applications.

Hypothesis 1 (H1): Formal recognition of COVID-19 as a
global pandemic produces an increase in job applications
during the onset (transition) period (relative to preonset application rates).
Job search theory and research do not explain precisely how
macro events change job search behavior over time. However,
event system theory predicts the nature of the posttransition
change should depend on event strength as time progresses
(Morgeson et al., 2015). For example, a recession may see little
change in job search behavior at the onset because the event is not
immediately disruptive or critical. As the effects of the recession
become more apparent (disruption increases), job search behavior
changes drastically. On the other hand, a terrorist attack may be
immediately disruptive and critical and thus may quickly change
job search behavior, but the effects of this event on job search
become less apparent over time (as disruption and criticality decrease). In this way, the differences in event strength are associated
with differences in the timing, duration, and magnitude of consequences (Bliese et al., 2017).
We predict that the rate of applications should continue to
increase after the onset of the pandemic (postonset period) because
the macro context following the pandemic’s onset continued to
evolve. The pandemic’s novelty obviously decreased after the
onset transition period. However, as the virus became more widespread, the pandemic’s disruption and criticality likely increased.1
Unemployment rates and layoffs began to rise sharply, and the
number of people not able to work increased because of shutdowns. The growing environmental uncertainty during the postonset period likely contributed to greater employment uncertainty
and thus more applications (Bianchi, 2013; Porter et al., 2019;
Wanberg et al., 2012; Wanberg, van Hooft, et al., 2020).
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Relative to preonset applications, postonset applications will increase over time.
The first two hypotheses test whether the COVID-19 pandemic
changed job search behavior. We now seek to provide a more
nuanced understanding of these effects by examining if they are
consistent across different types of jobs. We hypothesize that the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic should result in increases in job
applications to work-from-home jobs, relative to preonset levels.
We note above that stronger macroeconomic events prompt uncertainty and loss of control (Bianchi, 2020; Sirola & Pitesa,
2018). The COVID-19 pandemic is stronger than most macro
events because it creates threats to economic and physical health.
Health and safety are not frequently considered in prior research
on characteristics influencing job search. However, theory from
labor economics suggests that shifts in job search can result from
the safety and security offered by an occupation (e.g., Bellante &
Link, 1981; Cappelli, 2008).
Event system theory (Morgeson et al., 2015) and Bliese et al.
(2017) offer insights regarding why job applications to work-fromhome jobs will increase. Criticality is the dimension that pertains to an
event’s potential to have an influence on “the ‘horizon’ . . . and may
curtail the attainment of important goals such that the ‘centrality of the
goal at stake in the exchange matters” (Morgeson et al., 2015, p. 521).

The pandemic event specifically makes face-to-face jobs unsafe, from
both a financial perspective (face-to-face jobs are most likely to be
lost during the pandemic because of business closures) and a health
perspective (face-to-face jobs are more likely to result in one getting
sick; Rudolph et al., in press). Therefore, work-from-home jobs are a
better alternative at the pandemic’s onset, leading to the prediction
that applications to work-from-home jobs will increase.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Relative to preonset application rates,
organizations offering work-from-home jobs will experience
an increase in applications during the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic (transition period) compared to organizations offering face-to-face jobs.
Likewise, postonset, jobseekers will apply to work-from-home jobs
at an increasing rate relative to preonset levels. H3 argues that workfrom-home jobs offer the greatest means to increase control and
reduce uncertainty caused by the pandemic’s simultaneous impact on
economics and health. Further, time increases the disruption and
criticality associated with the event, thus increasing event strength.
Specifically, as the health (e.g., the virus becomes more widespread
and individuals begin to see the effects of the virus on people close to
them) and economic (e.g., the loss of face-to-face jobs in the community increases) environments worsen, the desire for work-fromhome jobs will increase in an attempt to offset the potential negative
consequences associated with the virus (e.g., Rudolph et al., in press).
Thus, as the pandemic spreads in the postonset period, workers should
increasingly apply to work-from-home jobs relative to preonset levels.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Relative to preonset application rates,
organizations offering work-from-home jobs will experience a
postonset increase in applications compared to organizations
offering face-to-face jobs.

Method
Sample and Procedure
The data in this sample are based on 14 organizations that were
clients of a global talent acquisition vendor (University of South
Carolina IRB Pro00100146; “Job Search Change as a Result of a
Disruptive Event”). This is the first publication from a larger data set.
Four of the organizations offer work-from-home jobs, while the
remaining 10 organizations offer traditional face-to-face jobs (see
Table 1). The organizations represent a fairly diverse range of industries. Eight of the firms hired nationally, with the remainder focused
on regional hiring (e.g., Southwest, Northeast). Six of the firms hired
in urban areas, two in suburban areas, and the rest a mix of both.2 The
vendor tracks the number of applications to each organization on a
daily basis (no demographic data were collected during the application stage). We cluster the data weekly as a means to balance having
a large number of repeated observations versus having so many that
the models run into convergence problems (see Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010). Thus, the pandemic onset occurs the week of March 9,
1
The fact that the pandemic’s strength (i.e., novelty, disruption, and
criticality) theoretically changes between onset and postonset periods is yet
another reason why onset and postonset periods should be disentangled.

with data collection starting January 6 and ending the week of April
20. All 14 organizations, each with 16 weeks of data and all job
applications in this window, are included in the analyses.
To provide further insights into the change in job applications, we
also examined weekly mean selection test performance. Each firm
uses a battery of cognitive, noncognitive, and situational judgment
assessments. The specific constructs measured and the weighting of
the different scores are specific to each firm as determined by a job
analysis and validation study. The vendor converts applicant scores
into a percentage from zero to 100 (100% indicates perfect fit).

Analytic Approach
A strength of this study’s design is the multiple waves of data and,
importantly, 9 weeks of preonset baseline data (see Table 2).
DRCGCMs are ideally suited for this situation (Bliese et al., 2017)

because they enable one to test whether the pandemic’s onset and
postonset slope differ relative to the preonset slope, as a means to
estimate how much the pandemic changed job search application
behavior relative to the baseline period. Further, these models enable
us to test whether differences observed in the onset and postonset
slopes are (at least in part) explained by job type (face-to-face vs.
work-from-home). We followed the approach described by Bliese,
Lang, and colleagues (Bliese et al., 2017; Bliese & Lang, 2016; Lang
& Bliese, 2009) and used in research seeking to examine discontinuous trends (e.g., the Great Recession; Kim & Ployhart, 2014).
DRCGCMs are extensions of the basic growth curve model (Singer &
Willett, 2003) and similar to regression discontinuity designs used in
economics (Imbens & Lemieux, 2008).
The DRCGCM regresses the outcome (vector of each firm’s
weekly job applications) onto a set of growth terms. These terms are

structured so that they model specific forms of hypothesized change
and thus disentangle different forms of variance (see Table 2). The
preonset term captures the linear baseline slope. The pandemic onset
term is coded zero (before the event) and 1 (after the event), thus
estimating how applications changed the week of March 9. As the unit
for “time” in our study is 1 week, we specify the transition period to
be the shortest period possible to provide the most precise estimate of
the event variance (Bliese & Lang, 2016). Longer periods of time
would confound the onset variance with the postonset variance. We
consider the possibility of nonlinear (quadratic or negatively accelerated) change in the postonset period by using two terms: postonset
and postonset squared (e.g., Lang & Bliese, 2009). The postonset
terms use zeros before and during the pandemic’s onset so that change
is modeled only after the transition period. The intercept is a constant
of 1s to estimate the start period.
Just as dummy codes or effects coding enable different contrasts in
the general linear model, the terms in Table 2 work together to
uniquely estimate preonset, onset, and postonset variance as shown in
Figure 1. H1 is supported by a significant pandemic onset term, H2 is
supported by significant postonset terms, H3 is supported by significant pandemic onset by job type interaction, and H4 is supported by
a significant postonset by job type interaction and postonset2 by job
type interaction (both terms must be significant for full support; one
significant term is indicative of partial support). SAS (Version 9.4)
proc mixed with restricted maximum likelihood is used for the analyses. H tests are based on Type I sequential sums of squares, which
means that the coefficients are tested sequentially based on the order
they enter the model. Order of entry is important when using polynomials, so one should test the lower-order terms before adding
higher-order terms (Bliese & Ployhart, 2002). Pseudo-R2 is estimated
using Xu (2003).
DRCGCMs allow the estimation of variance components or the
amount of between-firm variability in each term in Table 2. Allowing
the growth terms to vary across firms, including the intercept (initial
status), enables us to model how the pandemic has influenced application rates across firms and helps reduce concerns about preexisting
between-firm differences (see Bliese & Lang, 2016; Bliese, Schepker,
Essman, & Ployhart, 2020). This allows one to disentangle the variance associated with the preonset, onset, and postonset periods (see
Bliese et al., 2017; Bliese & Lang, 2016; Lang & Bliese, 2009).
Statistical tests for variance components are low power because
variance components cannot fall below zero (Bliese & Ployhart,
2002), so one-tailed tests are used according to common practice
(Littell, Milliken, Stroup, & Wolfinger, 1996). But perhaps the most
important benefit of using DRCGCMs is that pandemic onset effect
and postonset slope are compared relative to preonset slopes (i.e.,
baseline levels). For example, the onset by job type interaction is
tested relative to what would have been predicted given the baseline
data.

(week of Marth 9), applications jumped a statistically significant
726.99 relative to expected preonset levels. The variance component for the pandemic onset (u ⫽ 1,561,095) is statistically significant, suggesting there are between-firm differences in the effect
of the pandemic onset. In contrast, H2 is not supported, as neither
the postonset slopes nor their variance components were statistically significant. Altogether, Model 1 suggests the onset of the
pandemic produces a large mean increase in applications during
the onset of the pandemic, and this transition effect continues
through the postonset period. The pandemic’s onset effect is so
strong that it largely determines the shape of the postonset period.
H3 predicted that, relative to expected preonset trends, organizations offering work-from-home jobs will experience an increase
in applications during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to organizations offering face-to-face jobs. Model 3 (see
Table 4) shows H3 is supported. Organizations that offer workfrom-home jobs see a significant increase of 2,737.42 more applications during the onset of the pandemic than organizations offering face-to-face jobs (relative to preonset levels). Further, the
variance component for the pandemic onset term is no longer
statistically significant, indicating that job type (face-to-face vs.
work-from-home) accounts for the explainable variance. H4 is
marginally supported, as the quadratic term (postonset slope2) is
significant but the linear postonset slope is not (there was also
difficulty getting an estimate for the slope’s variance component,
which is common when modeling such trends; Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010). This means that work-from-home jobs exhibit a
modest negatively accelerated increase in applications. Figure 2
illustrates Model 3.3

Supplemental Analyses
We report a number of supplemental analyses to evaluate the
robustness of the findings and consider alternative explanations.
First, one might question whether unemployment rates are causing
the increase in job applications. To test this possibility, we modeled weekly unemployment claims as a time-varying predictor in
the DRCGCMs along with the existing terms. The results found
that unemployment claims did not significantly predict job applications (p ⫽ .17), while the significant effects for the pandemic
onset and job type still held. Indeed, the unemployment claims rate
was relatively steady and did not rise until after the pandemic’s
onset, which argues against unemployment causing the onset effect
(lagging the unemployment–application relationships by 1- or
2-week intervals made no difference). Further, hypothesis tests
suggest that only work-from-home jobs saw a significant increase
in the pandemic onset and postonset periods. If unemployment was
the primary explanation for the increase in job applications, one
would expect there to be at least some meaningful increase in
applications to face-to-face jobs, but this is not the case. Second,
we tested for the possibility of cyclical hiring trends by comparing
2020 data to a subset of the organizations that were clients during
the same weeks (January–April) in 2019. No significant onset was
found in the same time period in 2019, and the pattern of applications differed from 2020, suggesting cyclical effects are not
present.
Third, we consider whether changes in the quality of applicants
over time might account for the differences in application rates.
We used the same models used to test the hypotheses but with

candidate test scores as the outcome. The results found no significant changes in applicant quality over time and no significant
differences between job types. The mean candidate fit was essentially unchanged over time and not an explanation of the changes
in job applications. Fourth, we examine if changes in job openings
affect applications. Based on a survey of the client project managers, one work-from-home organization and four face-to-face
organizations indicated increased job openings, two face-to-face
organizations indicated decreased job openings, and the rest were
unchanged. Including job openings as a variable in the model
(coded 1 ⫽ increased openings, 0 ⫽ no change, ⫺1 ⫽ decreased
openings) does not change support for any of the hypotheses.
Thus, volume in applications did not change because of job openings.
Finally, given that work-from-home jobs have a larger number
of job applications at all time periods, one may question whether
the comparison between the two groups is fair. Applying the
DRCGCM to only the face-to-face organizations found no significant change for the preonset, onset, or postonset periods— essentially a flat line over time. In contrast, applying the models on only
the work-from-home firms produced a trajectory similar to the
hypothesis tests and found significant effects for the pandemic
onset. Thus, the job application rates are not affected by changes
in applicant supply (unemployment rates), changes in applicant
quality (test scores), or changes in demand (job openings). All of
these results are available upon request.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in terms of speed
and global impact. We sought to advance practice in ways that help
organizations understand the crisis created by COVID-19 while
simultaneously advancing job search theory in ways that generalize beyond the crisis. By applying a rigorous DRCGCM approach,
we found (a) the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset led to a large
immediate increase in job applications, (b) this increase occurred
primarily due to a stronger increase in applications to work-fromhome jobs, and (c) most of the impact occurred during the pandemic’s onset, as the postonset period showed a modest negatively
accelerated increase in applications for work-from-home jobs. The
longitudinal baseline and modeling approach used in this study
offer reasonably strong evidence that it was the introduction of the
COVID-19 pandemic that created this disruption in job applications. Supplemental analyses reinforce this interpretation, as neither unemployment claims nor candidate quality scores account for
the change in applications.
3
Although the diversity of organizations in this study helps ensure
findings are not industry specific, it could also create difficulties in making
comparisons across firms or jobs. To evaluate this possibility, we ran
analyses that limited the organizations to jobs that focused only on customer service or sales (Organizations 1, 2, 6, and 11–14 in Table 1) and
analyses that excluded organizations with jobs that were not focused
primarily on customer service or sales job (i.e., excluding Organizations 4,
5, and 10 in Table 1). We compared these results to each other and the
effects reported above. The effect sizes were highly similar across models,
and support for all hypothesis tests was the same except for H4, which
approached but did not reach statistical significance (perhaps because this
analysis used only 3 of the 10 face-to-face organizations). Analyses are
available upon request.

COVID-19: EFFECTS ON JOB SEARCH

Figure 2.

Average number of applicants over time by job type.

This research offers important implications for job search theory
and for directing future research, especially given that context has
not played a central role in the job search literature (Boswell et al.,
2012; Wanberg et al., 2012). First, we introduce event system
theory and transition frameworks as a means to conceptualize,
theorize, and analyze job search. Job search is punctuated by many
acute events, including college graduation, job acceptance, and job
loss. A nascent area of research is starting to recognize that macro
events may also influence search, such that job search during times
of hardship and uncertainty contributes to a loss of control or
increased gratitude (Bianchi, 2020; Peterson & Seligman, 2003).
Yet in prior research, the event itself is rarely given careful
theoretical attention, and the transition period associated with the
event is usually ignored or confounded with the posttransition
period.
The approach used in this study thus offers new ways to think
about events that punctuate job search—macro or otherwise. Not
all events have the same consequences. The effects of an event are
largely determined by event strength, which lies on a continuum.
Research should apply event system theory to compare and contrast the strength of different events (e.g., compare the novelty,
disruption, and criticality of furloughs, expected job loss, unexpected job loss, layoffs) to determine how they create different
transition and posttransition reactions (see Halbesleben, Wheeler,
& Paustian-Underdahl, 2013, for one example).4 Failing to appropriately understand events can lead to inconsistent or even contradictory findings. For example, the effectiveness of interventions
used to facilitate job search during times of economic recession
may differ from the effectiveness during times of economic pros-

perity (Liu et al., 2014). Conceptualizing job search events along
a continuum of event strength, as proposed by Morgeson et al.
(2015), should help improve the understanding and reporting of
context in job search articles, which in turn could improve metaanalyses and the ability to identify contextual moderators of predictive relationships (Wanberg, Ali, et al., 2020).
A second theoretical implication involves consideration of how
outcomes and the predictors of such outcomes may change across
event preonset, onset, and postonset periods. Our study found a
slow decline in job applications to work-from-home jobs, but this
changed abruptly and significantly once the pandemic onset occurred, suggesting the predictors of job application behavior (i.e.,
job type) changed over time. Future research should examine if the
predictors of job search behavior change across preonset, onset,
and postonset periods for different types of events (varying on
strength). Such relationships cannot be examined without sufficient baseline data and the application of models capable of testing
discontinuity and change (Bliese et al., 2017). Thus, this study’s
approach may be used to better understand how the strength of
events, macro and micro, influence the predictors of job search
over time.

4
We compared the effects of the COVID-19 onset to other macro events
occurring in 2020 (Brexit) and 2019 (Trump impeachment). Theoretically,
these other events are weaker than the COVID-19 onset because they are
both less disruptive and critical for employment. Consistent with event
system theory predictions, neither of these other events created a significant onset effect. We thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion.

MCFARLAND, REEVES, PORR, AND PLOYHART

Our study also offers some important practical implications.
First, event system theory and the transitions framework introduced here can help firms understand events in new ways and thus
provide a greater ability to strategically anticipate or respond to
macro events. Reeves, Whitaker, and Ketels (2019) argue that
environmental complexity and uncertainty appear to be more frequent. If firms try to understand the wide variety of potential
macro events without an organizing framework, then strategies
will need to be based on each event (e.g., responses for terrorist
attacks, health crises, economic crises, and all the variations within
these). This is obviously an unwieldy and impractical approach,
especially for events that are strong but infrequent or difficult to
predict. On the other hand, organizations could apply event system
theory to understand these events in terms of their key underlying
features: novelty, disruption, and criticality. It is likely that many
seemingly different events are actually similar in terms of their
strength, and hence the organizational responses can be similar as
well. This provides a simpler and more flexible approach to
strategic planning.
Second, recognizing that the onset transition is different from
the postonset period helps firms better react to change. For example, it may seem apparent that people will apply to work-fromhome jobs when a pandemic begins. However, the difficult question facing managers is whether these effects are strong enough
and last long enough to justify investing in work-from-home
opportunities. Strategy is about making choices about where to
invest and where not to invest. Should firms make more workfrom-home opportunities, recognizing that doing so will require
significant resource investments (e.g., hardware, infrastructure),
training (performance management), and cultural change? If one
believed the increase in work-from-home jobs was driven by
unemployment, a firm may decide not to make such investments,
believing the demand will subside as unemployment decreases.
Our study shows this is not the case. Thus, event system theory and
the transition approach provide a way for firms to make better
strategic decisions and can be used as a tool to improve strategic
planning and forecasting.
Of course, this study has potential limitations that need to be
addressed in future research. First, we were not able to measure the
psychological reactions or experience of the pandemic’s onset
period. We theorized that the onset created uncertainty that led to
increased applications, but such explanatory processes need to be
tested in future research. Consistent with such expectations, a
follow-up survey administered to a nationally representative sample of U.S. workers in late March found that 82% of job seekers
were more anxious about their current job search than they would
be normally (z ⫽ 5.76; p ⬍ .001), and 74% indicated they needed
additional job search support (z ⫽ 6.97; p ⬍ .001; results available
upon request). Future research thus needs to consider how the
perceptions and experiences observed shortly after the pandemic’s
onset continue as the pandemic evolves. Second, we modeled the
transition period as the week during which the COVID-19 virus
was recognized as a pandemic. This is consistent with similar
approaches using DRCGCM and provides the most rigorous test of
the onset (Bliese & Lang, 2016), but theoretical work is needed to
more precisely define when a transition point ends. Third, in the
weeks following the onset, many locations have reopened their
economies and so the effects observed here may (or may not)
generalize to later time periods. There may also be differences

across geographic regions, and although we did not find any
effects due to the geographic location of hiring (national vs.
regional) or population type (urban/suburban), future research
should explore this further.
One century ago, the Journal of Applied Psychology was born at
a time when applied psychology was desperately needed: World
War I was waging and the 1918 flu pandemic was beginning. It
began from a desire to apply the best of psychological science to
better human work conditions (Hall, Baird, & Geissler, 1917). We
have sought to follow this tradition by seeking to understand the
effects of COVID-19 (and event strength more broadly) on job
search behavior, to help individuals and organizations better adapt
to a changing world.
