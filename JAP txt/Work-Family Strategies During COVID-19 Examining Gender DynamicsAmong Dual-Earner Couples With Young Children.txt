There are several existing typologies of dual-earner couples focused on how they dually manage work
and family; however, these all assume that couples can outsource childcare during normal work hours and
that work is largely conducted outside of the home. Early attempts to control COVID-19 altered these
assumptions with daycares/schools closing and the heavy shift to remote work. This calls into question
whether couples tended to fall back on familiar gendered patterns to manage work and family, or if they
adopted new strategies for the unique pandemic situation. We addressed this question using a sample of
274 dual-earner couples with young children. We content coded couples’ qualitative responses about
their plans for managing childcare and work commitments and used these codes in a latent class analysis
to identify subgroups. Seven classes were identified, with 36.6% of the sample using strategies where
women did most or all childcare, 18.9% of the sample using strategies that were not clearly gendered or
egalitarian, and 44.5% of the sample using unique egalitarian strategies. We also obtained data from 133
of these couples approximately 7 weeks later regarding their well-being and job performance. Results
suggested that women in the Remote Wife Does It All class had the lowest well-being and performance.
There were nuanced differences between the egalitarian strategies in their relationships with outcomes,
with the Alternating Days egalitarian category emerging as the overall strategy that best preserved wives’
and husbands’ well-being while allowing both to maintain adequate job performance.

The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United
States introduced an unprecedented context that altered these assumptions. Specifically, institutional and governmental reactions
to control the pandemic included the closing of most childcare
centers and in-person schools. This sudden substantial increase in
childcare responsibilities for dual-earner couples was not necessarily balanced by a reduction in work responsibilities; couples
were together confronted with the immediate and ongoing need to
simultaneously fulfill both work and childcare roles. That is, the
division of childcare labor was no longer confined to hours outside
of the typical workday, and the boundaries between work and
home became blurred for many. Additionally, with the heavy shift
to remote work (Hickman & Saad, 2020), men were much more
physically present in the home than ever before. Physical proximity, and the associated increased salience of family demands, had
the potential to markedly shift traditional gendered patterns of
behavior.
Despite anecdotal discussion of gendered strategies in the popular press (e.g., Charlton, 2020; Cohen & Hsu, 2020; Smith, 2020),
there are no known empirical tests of what strategies couples are
actually using to manage childcare during COVID-19. As such, we
do not have knowledge of whether these strategies are highly
gendered (as tended to be the case pre-COVID-19) or if new, more
egalitarian strategies are being adopted in light of the unique
context. Based on these ideas, the goal of the present study was to
address the question of whether, in the COVID-19 context, couples
are creating novel work-family (WF) management strategies that
transcend gender roles or if they are falling back on the familiar

Researchers have noted several typologies of broad strategies
that dual-earner couples use to generally manage work and family
(e.g., Hall & MacDermid, 2009; Masterson & Hoobler, 2015;
Sweet & Moen, 2006). There are nuanced differences across these
typologies, but a common trend is that the most prevalent strategies involve some form of a “neo-traditional” division of labor,
where women are primary caretakers inside the home and take on
disproportionately more childcare and men work primarily outside
the home and their careers are prioritized. This research also
assumes that dual-earner couples have the option to outsource
childcare during normal work hours and that work is largely
conducted outside of the home.

patterns seen in previous research during “typical” times. Importantly, we further examined the relationship of these strategies with
men and women’s job performance and well-being (including
health and family functioning). We addressed these questions in a
sample of dual-earner heterosexual couples with young children
(under age 6) who had stable childcare arrangements preCOVID-19 but whose childcare arrangements were subsequently
disrupted. We surveyed them the week that childcare arrangements
were largely suspended across the United States and 6.5– 8.5
weeks later to assess outcomes.
Our research makes several important contributions to the literature. First, in providing basic information about couples’ WF
management strategies during the pandemic and how these strategies link to key outcomes, we hope to answer calls to examine
WF situations in times of crisis (Eby et al., 2015) and to contribute
to the literature about best practices during such times. The
COVID-19 pandemic can be considered a crisis situation, defined
as a “low-probability, high impact event” that is characterized by
ambiguity, uncertainty regarding means of resolution, and significant consequences (Yu et al., 2008). Given the crisis context, one
cannot assume prior typologies of couples’ WF management strategies would mirror current findings. Crisis situations may have
discontinuous effects on individuals and couples (Eby et al., 2015)
and reveal new, complex associations between division of labor
and outcomes. If we find that certain strategies are better in this
crisis situation than others for well-being and performance, couples may gain insight into how they may adjust their own strategies
moving forward during the pandemic, in other crisis situations in
the future (e.g., natural disasters), or even in more minor situations
once COVID-19 has subsided (e.g., child is sick for a few days and
must stay home).
Second, our study empirically answers anecdotal questions
about gender and childcare during the pandemic. By examining the
gender dynamics within couples’ WF management strategies, we
provide important evidence that has implications for understanding
(a) potential downstream career consequences for men and women
and (b) the extent to which the gendered separate spheres of work
and home are fixed versus adaptive to crisis. With regard to the
former point, if women take on the bulk of childcare duties during
the pandemic, this could be a leading indicator of backtracking in
women’s progression in organizations. With regard to the latter
point, understanding what happens when work and home are in the
same sphere for both men and women offers a unique lens into the
malleability of the gendered division of household labor.
A third contribution of our study is linking dual-earner WF
management strategies to well-being and performance outcomes.
There is a surprising dearth of research on this topic generally.
Although we focus on short-term implications in the context of a
pandemic, our findings may be able to guide research outside the
pandemic as well (e.g., short-term relationship tension stemming
from a particular WF management strategy may manifest in more
stable attitudes such as marital dissatisfaction if that strategy is
adopted long-term). Furthermore, short-term implications are important in their own right as they can have meaningful downstream
effects on individual well-being (e.g., lack of sleep has been linked
to obesity, hypertension, and diabetes; Altman et al., 2012), relationship outcomes (e.g., tension from this situation may simmer
and resentment may build between spouses), and workplace out-

comes (e.g., companies may use the current situation to make
long-term decisions such as promotions or raises).

Dual-Earner Couples’ Work-Family
Management Strategies
There are numerous extant typologies of dual-earner couples in
the literature and they vary in the focal variable used to categorize
couples, including work and family salience (Yogev & Brett,
1985), family identity (Masterson & Hoobler, 2015), career decisions (Becker & Moen, 1999; Pixley, 2008), hours in childcare,
household labor, and/or paid employment of each spouse (Hall &
MacDermid, 2009; Kitterød & Lappegård, 2012; Sweet & Moen,
2006). Common themes across typologies include some version of
the following: (a) both people are highly committed to work and to
family demands, and may rely on specific strategies such as
outsourcing, reducing performance standards, or reducing sleep
time, (b) asymmetrical strategies that involve one person devoting
more to work (family) while the other devotes more time to the
other domain, (c) and one person taking on the bulk of family labor
while not scaling back at work. The latter two strategies are highly
gendered—it is usually the wife who scales back work or takes on
a “second shift”—and they represent a large proportion of couples
in most studies.
Turning to the COVID-19 context, we draw from multiple
theoretical lenses to inform why potential WF management strategies may be highly gendered as found in previous work, or may
depart from this pattern. Numerous theories have been put forth to
explain the gendered division of labor (cf. Shockley & Shen,
2016); we hone in on theories that focus on gender itself rather
than factors that correlate with gender (e.g., relative resources,
economic theories of specialization). The “doing gender” (West &
Zimmerman, 1987, 2009) perspective argues that due to gender
role socialization women (men) view domestic (paid) labor as an
act that affirms femininity (masculinity), which contributes to the
asymmetrical patterns. Similarly, Blair-Loy (2003) asserts couples
rarely question the idea that the wife rather than the husband
should cut back on work to care for children because of internalized cultural schemas of women’s family devotion (Eagly, 1987;
Haines et al., 2016). Additionally, marital power theories (Rollins
& Bahr, 1976) argue that the person with more power in a marriage
prevails in situations of conflicting goals (e.g., who will sacrifice
work when childcare is necessary). Holding other factors (e.g.,
relative resources) constant, gender (being male) is a predictor of
power in part due to hegemonic masculinity embedded in society
(e.g., Lukes, 2005; Messerschmidt, 2018). There is little reason to
suspect that COVID-19 would fundamentally alter any of these
aforementioned processes, suggesting that WF management strategies during COVID-19 mimic the gendered strategies commonly
used before the pandemic. Indeed, a rare study of WF strategies
during a crisis (Sigurdardottir & Garðarsdóttir, 2018) suggests a
gendered trend. Researchers found that Icelandic men took shorter
parental leave after the 2008 economic recession compared to the
preceding 4 years, although the opposite trend was observed for
women, who took longer leaves.
On the other hand, characteristics unique to COVID-19 invoke
other theoretical concepts that introduce the potential for new
strategies. The notion that men and women can and should be
relegated to (or maintain primary responsibility for) work and

home roles, respectively, is deeply ingrained in social norms
around the globe (e.g., the concept of “separate spheres”; Davis &
Greenstein, 2009; Kerber, 1988). Yet the situational demands
imposed by the pandemic have the potential to disrupt those norms
for a variety of reasons. First, the restriction of movement imposed
by the pandemic meant that work and home were no longer
separate spaces; the sharp increase in remote work resulted in a
sharp decrease in the physical boundaries between work and home.
This meant that many men no longer had the option of leaving
home for work and were thus physically embedded with their
families. Meal preparation and emotional and physical needs of
children may have been more immediately salient for men than
ever before.
Second, the pandemic confronted couples with a necessary and
urgent decision-making context often involving substantial
changes to both members’ work arrangements. This context is
meaningfully different from previously studied decisions, such as
whether one partner should take a new job or which partner is
responsible for picking up a sick child, because it explicitly involves both partners’ work and home lives. The possibility that
work and home could be separate spheres for men and women may
have been completely disrupted by the pandemic and thus allow
for noticeable change.
Third, the double ABCX model of family stress and adaptation
(Hill, 1958; McCubbin & Patterson, 1983) explicitly focuses on
how families adapt to crisis situations. The model is complex, but
a core idea is that the successful coping of families to crisis
situations depends in part on their ability to accept shifting role
patterns and expectations (Hill, 1958). A key takeaway relevant to
the present context is that many couples do substantially shift their
roles in reaction to crisis situations rather than rely on previous
defaults.
Based on these varying perspectives, we pose the following as
a research question:
Research Question 1: In the COVID-19 context, are couples
using unique, new WF management strategies or are they
falling back on the familiar gendered patterns found in previous research?

Outcomes of Couples’ Work-Family
Management Strategies
As noted above, there is very little research linking general
couple-level WF management strategies to well-being or job performance outcomes. However, some evidence can be gleaned from
the related general division of labor literature. Research on uneven
division of family labor is quite mixed in terms of marital quality
and the relationship seems to be moderated by perceptions of
fairness, such that marital quality decreases for the person doing
more labor if he or she feels it is unfair (cf. Shockley & Shen,
2016). In terms of health outcomes, psychological distress has
received the most attention, with the bulk of studies finding that
couples who divide paid and family labor in an egalitarian manner
experience the lowest distress. Lastly, there is some evidence when
women’s careers are prioritized or they earn more than men (e.g.,
a “non-traditional” division of paid labor) both men and women
have poorer health outcomes (cf. Shockley & Shen, 2016). In
summary, the trend seems to be that more egalitarian strategies

17

lead to most favorable outcomes at least for health and marital
outcomes, although there are some nuances to these findings based
on the nature of the nonegalitarian strategy and gender.
In the present context, we decided to focus on well-being in the
family, health, and job performance domains for a holistic assessment. Rather than focusing on more enduring attitudes such as
marital satisfaction, we examined marital relationship tension
which may vary more on a short-term basis (Birditt et al., 2017).
We also examined family cohesion, with the idea that strategies
chosen during COVID-19 could impact the family as a whole
rather than just the couple. In terms of health, we focused on
psychological distress given the precedent in the literature, as well
as sleep hours. We thought sleep hours were particularly important
during the pandemic because of the time crunch with added
childcare, resulting in potential cuts to sleep. Finally, in order to
see the job-related implications, we used two indicators of selfreported job performance (general job performance and job performance relative to pre-COVID-19) over the study period. For
each outcome, we examined the wives’ and husbands’ reports
separately. For variables that were individual in nature (performance and health variables) we also calculated a summed variable
to represent well-being and performance across the couple.
Research Question 2: To what extent do the respective WF
strategies relate to wives’ and husbands’ family functioning
(relationship tension, family cohesion), health (sleep hours
and psychological distress), and job performance?

Method
Participants
Participants were 334 married couples living in the United
States (668 individuals). In order to be eligible, couples had to
meet the following criteria at the Time 1 survey: Both spouses
worked full-time (⬎32 hr per week) and were still required to
work (whether remote or not) during sheltering in place orders.
The couple had to have at least one child under age 6 with regular
daytime childcare unavailable (e.g., daycare was closed, nanny
could not come). We further screened out 35 couples because we
suspected that their responses were from a single person rather
than an actual couple1, and 16 additional couples because their
responses to the open-ended questions revealed they did not meet
the study criteria (i.e., unmarried or not working, n ⫽ 3), or their
open-ended responses were too terse or indecipherable (n ⫽ 13).
Lastly, we removed 9 couples in same sex marriages.2 Therefore,
we had usable data from 274 couples at Time 1.
The Time 1 survey was administered March 18 –23, 2020. This
was immediately following the closings of most schools and
daycare facilities across the United States, and the declaration of a

Couples were removed if both individuals were using the same email
address, their IP address and names were linked to multiple couples, or if
individuals were responding to emails and surveys directed towards their
spouse.
2
We removed same sex couples because our theoretical perspectives
were largely focused on different gender roles within a couple, for which
we used sex as a proxy. We believe issues of childcare during COVID-19
are equally relevant to same sex couples, but it did not fit into the particular
framework of this study.

national health emergency on March 13. Couples were recruited
via snowball methodology through posting on the researchers’
social networks and personal contacts (n ⫽ 51) and through paid
Facebook ads (n ⫽ 232). The “first” spouse completed the survey
first, provided his or her spouse’s email address and then the
“second” spouse was contacted about completing his or her survey.
The surveys were identical, except that eligibility questions and
couple-level demographic questions were only asked of the first
spouse. Couples were compensated $7 per person in Amazon gift
cards, or with a $2 donation to the World Health Organization
(WHO).
Time 2 surveys were administered May 7–18, 2020. At this
point in time, many states had only just begun their initial phases
of reopening (Lee et al., 2020) and schools and the majority of
childcare facilities remained closed (Guynn, 2020). This gave
participants a substantial period (6.5– 8.5 weeks) during which
they dealt with sheltering in place regulations and daycare and
school closures. A total of 188 couples completed the Time 2
survey. The Time 2 sample size was further reduced to 179 couples
after screening out those who failed more than one attention check
(described below) at either Time 1 or Time 2. The spouses received identical surveys and each person was compensated $5 in
Amazon gift cards or a $1 WHO donation. Demographics and
analysis for nonresponse bias are listed in Table 1. This study was
approved by the University of Georgia’s Institutional Review
Board (“Work and Family Struggles during the COVID-19 Outbreak”; Project #00002089).

childcare: (a) “What is you and your spouse’s plan for dealing with
both of your work commitments during the upcoming period when
your normal childcare is disrupted? Please be as detailed as possible.” (b) “How will you have to adjust your work role during this
time?” and (c) “How will your spouse have to adjust his/her work
role during this time?”

Implementation of Plan (Time 2)
Participants were first reminded of their verbatim response from
Time 1 regarding their intended plan. They were then asked to rate
how well they followed that plan. Responses were set on a 10point Likert scale ranging from did not follow the plan at all to
followed the plan perfectly.

Family Functioning (Time 2)
Family cohesion was assessed using Huffman et al.’s (2017)
3-item measure and marital relationship tension was assessed
using three items from Matthews et al.’s (2006). Responses were
set on a 5-point strongly disagree to strongly agree Likert scale.

Health
Sleep quantity was assessed by asking “During this time period,
on average, how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night?”
Psychological distress was assessed with Kessler et al.’s (2002)
10-item measure. Responses were set on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from none of the time to all of the time.

Measures

Job Performance

All items are listed in the Appendix. All items were completed
by both spouses. For Time 2 measures participants were asked to
reflect on the period since they took the first survey.

Self-rated job performance was assessed in two ways. First,
participants completed a four-item measure from Abramis (1994).
Responses were set on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very
poorly to exceptionally well. Second, we assessed the extent to
which participants felt they had met their work responsibilities
during this period using a study-created item: “During the pandemic many parents have not been able to meet 100% of their
work responsibilities. What percentage of your work responsibil-

Attention Checks
Five items were used to measure careless responding and were
presented randomly throughout the surveys (e.g., “I do not understand a word of English”). Responses were set on a 5-point Likert
scale that ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Responses were deemed incorrect if they did not select one of two
response options reflecting the correct level of agreement (e.g.,
strongly disagree or disagree in the example).
Scores across the couple (health, psychological distress, general
and relative job performance) were computed by summing the
individual scores.

Results
Coding of Stated Plans
We followed an inductive process in generating codes for the
descriptions of plans for managing childcare and work commitments. We reviewed the wife’s and husband’s reports in tandem to
provide a holistic assessment of the plans. Two of the study
authors each reviewed a unique subset of the data (20% each) and
independently generated common categories that emerged from
the descriptions as well as different codes within each category.
These categories were compared and refined. Next, all four of the
study authors reviewed a separate randomly selected subset of the
data (10%) and attempted to code using the initial code sheet. It
was agreed upon that substantial refinements to the coding sheet
were necessary. The coders met to discuss these refinements and
then formally coded the subset. Agreement was 89.3%. All instances where coders were not in perfect agreement were discussed
and further minor clarifications and revisions were made to the
coding sheet. We then moved forward in having two coders per
description. Agreement across cases and categories was 74.8%. In
all cases where there was a coding disagreement a third coder was
assigned. In 89.5% of these cases, the new coder chose one of the
existing codes and we selected the majority code. In the remaining
10.5%, a fourth coder reviewed the codes and a majority code
emerged.

Analyses
We address Research Question 1 in two ways. First, in Table 2,
we present the distinct categories that emerged from the data and
the prevalence of various alternatives within each category. Next,
in order to determine if certain patterns across categories emerged
within the data we conducted a latent class analysis (LCA), a
technique which identifies latent subgroups based on individual
responses from multivariate categorical data (Rindskopf, 2009).3
We conducted the LCA using Mplus 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén,
2015) and began by specifying one profile and increased the
number of profiles until fit no longer substantially improved.
Following best practice recommendations (e.g., Gabriel et al.,
2018), we determined fit by looking for lower values with the
Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), consistent AIC (C-AIC) and sample-size-adjusted BIC,
higher values for entropy, and significant values for the Lo-

19

Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test and the bootstrap likelihood
ratio test. The results of the LCA are shown in Table 3. As there
are no clear criteria for LCA fit indices, we looked at the various
indicators holistically, prioritizing those in which the BIC and
C-AIC values were lowest, to determine the best factor solution
(e.g., Peugh & Fan, 2013). The 7-factor solution has the lowest
BIC, C-AIC, and AIC; thus, we proceeded with 7 factors.
Table 4 shows the descriptive labels given to each class, representative quotes, and the proportion of couples in that class that
were assigned a particular code for each category. This gives a
sense of what the modal strategies across categories were for each
of the seven classes.
With regard to Research Question 1, several of the strategies
reflected gendered patterns. Specifically, two of the strategies—
Wife Remote and Does it All and Wife Remote and Husband
Pitches in on Occasion (“Wife Remote Doing Most”)— were
clearly gendered and included 31.8% of the sample. The Husband
Not Remote and Outsourcing Fully or Partially Outsourcing With
Wife Filling in Gap also had a gendered component for 36% of the
couples in this class, or 4.8% of the total sample. Thus, 36.6% of
the total sample used traditional gendered strategies.
Other categories emerged that have been noted in some previous
work as couple WF management strategies, albeit less common
ones, include Wife Not Remote and Staggering Shiftwork or Husband Does Childcare (10.4%). Outsourcing Fully (64% of
13.3% ⫽ 8.5%) has been mentioned in some conceptual work
(Masterson & Hoobler, 2015), but it seems fairly unique during
COVID-19 given the higher reliance on friends or family than
formal paid childcare.
Three unique egalitarian categories emerged—Alternating
Working Days While Not Remote and Reducing Hours (“Alternating Days”), Egalitarian Remote Workers With Planned Minishifts
(“Remote Mini-shifts”), Egalitarian Remote Workers With Daily
Need-based Alternation Without Reducing Work Hours (“Remote
Need-Based Alternating”). Together, these comprised 44.5% of
the sample. Thus, in response to Research Question 1 there was a
mix of unique and “typical” strategies.
To address Research Question 2, we examined mean differences
in the outcome variables by using the LCA automatic 3-step
approach for auxiliary variables (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2014)
where the outcome variables are examined in relation to class
membership probabilities, taking into account the error in class
prediction (Wang & Hanges, 2011). Before running these analyses,
we trimmed the data to only those who completed the Time 2
survey (n ⫽ 172). We also examined how well people followed
through with their plan and eliminated those who reported they had
followed through less than 6 on the 10-point scale (n ⫽ 39). We

3
LCA will only allow a maximum number of 10 options per category,
which was problematic with the Division of Childcare Labor During
Normal Work Hours category where there were 11. To remedy this, we
removed the category with the smallest n for men (“Doing all childcare
when not outsourced”) and women (“Doing none of the childcare when not
outsourced; n ⫽ 3 couples), reasoning that the n was likely too small to
create meaningful classes. These data were coded as missing on that
category.

felt this restriction was important for clarity in data interpretation.4
The final n for the outcome analyses was 133. Descriptive statistics
and correlations for all study variables are presented in Table 5.
Before running the LCA analyses, we examined potential control variables (number of children, household income, age, and
spousal age difference) due to their implications for how couples
divide labor as well as well-being outcomes. Classes were only
significantly different for income (mean income of each class is
listed in Table 4). We thus controlled for income in all analyses by
regressing the dependent variable of interest on income and using
the residuals in the LCA analysis (Bennett et al., 2016). However,
for interpretation purposes we reported the means of the original
variables (not residuals). Chi-square tests for overall significant
differences across classes and significance values are from analyses using residuals. Results are shown in Table 6.
There were significant differences in all outcomes except husbands’ sleep hours and husbands’ general job performance. For
relationship outcomes, both husbands and wives in the Wife Remote Doing Most group tended to fare among the best, whereas
both husbands and wives in the Wife Remote and Does It All group
fared the worst. Remote Minishifts couples also had high relationship tension scores comparatively. For health outcomes, the Alternating Days group generally fared the best, with the highest sleep
for both husbands and wives as well as the lowest or second lowest
psychological distress. Finally, for job performance, trends tended
to diverge by gender and type of performance. We elaborate more
on these differences in the Discussion.

Discussion
In this study, we sought to examine if the strategies dual-earner
couples are using to meet their competing work and childcare
demands during COVID-19 reflect progress toward a more egalitarian division of labor or remain highly gendered, and the link
between strategy choice and a range of outcomes. Even though the
separation of the spheres of work and home had largely disintegrated, and men were much more likely to be physically
present in their homes, we found evidence a substantial portion
of couples were engaging in highly gendered strategies. This
most commonly involved wives working remotely and taking
on all childcare with little adjustment to husbands’ work roles,
as well as similar scenarios wherein husbands pitched in with

childcare occasionally (e.g., one day a week or during an
important meeting for the wife). Even when some outsourcing
was available, the remainder of childcare mostly fell on wives.
This evidence confirms anecdotal reports of the persistent gendered division of labor during COVID-19.
Further concerning is that for many of the outcomes, women in
the most lopsided and common category (Wife Remote and Does It
All) experienced the least favorable outcomes of all classes, including lowest family cohesion, highest relationship tension, and
lowest job performance by both metrics. This is somewhat a
departure from research described previously, where results were
not consistently poorer for those doing all the labor. It may be due
in part to the fact that doing all of the childcare equates to many
more childcare hours overall than when childcare was outsourced
during work hours. Men in these couples were not immune to
negative outcomes, as they also experienced the lowest family
cohesion and highest relationship tension. Although their work
situations seemed minimally altered, job performance was rather
low compared to many of the other classes as well. Perhaps these
men are less focused at work due to marital strife resulting from
the increased WF burdens falling on their wives.
There are several practical implications of these findings. With
regards to the counterintuitive performance findings, it is important for companies to understand that withholding flexibility from
parents affects the entire couple—not just the member who picks
up the slack. From a societal standpoint, these results raise serious
concerns about potential setbacks in women’s career advancement.
Moreover, for couples who find themselves in a situation where
the wife can work remote and the husband cannot, our findings
suggest that they will fare considerably better if the husband
actively provides some relief by taking an occasional day off or
cutting hours short to support his remote partner. In fact, both
husbands and wives in the Wife Remote and Doing Most class had
significantly better relationship outcomes and relative job performance compared to those in the Wife Remote and Doing It All
class.
In addition to gendered strategies, multiple unique egalitarian
strategies emerged. We focus most of our discussion on these

strategies given their novelty and additional nuance than those
mentioned in previous typologies. Two of these (Remote Minishifts, Remote Need-Based Alternating) occurred when both
members of the couple were working remotely. This lends
support to the idea that the removal of separate spheres and
physical embeddedness of men in family spaces may facilitate
equality. Moreover, although these two strategies appear similar on the surface, they differ in regard to the specific manner
in which couples were trading off watching children. In one
class, partners scheduled minishifts (e.g., one person works
mornings and the other works afternoons). With this process
came a natural reduction in work hours for both partners for
many members of this class. In the other class, scheduling was
not as rigid and varied based on children’s needs and partners’
immediate work obligations and work hours were not reduced.
These distinct strategies resulted in some outcome differences,
most notably job performance. Husbands in the Remote Minishifts class reported significantly lower relative job performance than the Remote Need-Based Alternating and these couples had the lowest couple-level relative job performance of all
classes. Wives’ performance was relatively low as well, though
not significantly different than the Remote Need-Based Alternating class, and within the Remote Minishifts husbands’ performance suffered more than their wives.
The third unique egalitarian strategy (Alternating Days)
tended to occur when neither the wife nor husband were working remotely and were in jobs where they could each work
different days, which resulted in an overall reduction of hours
for both people. Comparing this strategy to the two other
egalitarian strategies, this group seemed to fare the best. They
had favorable means on all outcomes and wives performed
significantly better than the Remote Minishifts and had lower
psychological distress than both remote egalitarian groups.
Couple-level summed performance and psychological distress
were also more favorable. Finally, the Outsourcing Fully strategy was also egalitarian in the sense that neither member of the
couple was primarily responsible for childcare, allowing both to
maintain adequate levels of performance. This study provides
empirical support for implementation of the Outsourcing Fully
WF management strategy, which heretofore has been primarily
conceptual (Masterson & Hoobler, 2015).
From a practical standpoint, our findings suggest that although it varies somewhat by specific outcome, Alternating
Days may be the best strategy for couples, especially those who
are not working remotely. It preserves well-being while maintaining adequate levels of performance. Speculatively, by virtue
of alternating, both people in these couples were essentially
able to keep work and family segmented, which has been linked
to better health and performance outcomes (e.g., Kinnunen et
al., 2016; Smit et al., 2016). From a theoretical sense, this
suggests that it may not so much be the separation of gender
spheres but rather the separation of work and family life that
helps couples thrive. It is important to note that this strategy
may not be an option for all job types or for all couples if it
results in income loss, although it does suggest that organizations might reconsider requiring workers to report every day
during the pandemic. They may perform just as well while
being less distressed under this arrangement versus one where
they try to work every day. Public policy could help achieve

different from each other at least at p ⬍ .05. For example, for husbands, the Alternating Working Days While Not Remote and Reducing Hours group is
significantly different in sleep hours than the Wife Remote and Does it All and the Husband Not Remote and Outsourcing Fully or Partially Outsourcing
with Wife Filling in Gaps groups, but the Wife Remote and Husband Pitches in on Occasion, Wife Not Remote and Staggering Shiftwork or Husband Does
Childcare, Egalitarian Remote Workers With Planned Mini-shifts, and the Egalitarian Remote Workers with Daily Need-Based Alternation Without
Reducing Hours groups are not significantly different from one another. Mean differences between classes should only be interpreted when the overall

this as well by supplementing incomes or providing flexibility
mandates.
Also intertwined in strategy choice is the location of work.
Many workers were required to work remotely due to state
mandated closures, and in that case, were less likely to adopt
the Alternating Days strategy. Given projections that location
flexibility is here to stay (Ozimek, 2020) many couples may
find themselves both working remotely in the future. In this
case when both people are working remotely, our results suggest that couples would be advised to adopt a more flexible
approach (e.g., Remote Need-Based Alternating) rather than
rigid minishift schedule. It is unclear which mechanisms are
driving the differences. Speculatively, it may be enhanced
communication that this strategy requires, the fact that couples
are more responsive to each other’s needs and that reduces
marital tension (indeed there was a trend for lower marital
tension in the Remote Need-Based Alternating class), or having
a shared meaning of the situation—a key component the Double
ABCX theory (e.g., Weber, 2011). Future research would ben-

efit from testing these mechanisms to derive even more specific
recommendations.
Our results must be interpreted in light of a few limitations.
First, our sample had a high average income, drawing into
question its broader generalizability to lower income workers.
We also used self-report measures of job performance, which
can be prone to inflation (DeNisi & Murphy, 2017). Third, we
were focused on the very narrow context of COVID-19. However, we believe our results still have important implications for
couples in other situations that share some features of the
pandemic, including extreme weather where schools and daycares may close but workplaces still require remote work,
situations where children have a disability or chronic illness and
cannot attend typical childcare arrangements, or even parents
facing long daycare waitlists (e.g., Shellenbarger, 2010) and
must manage work with an infant at home.
In closing, our research presents a rare glimpse into how dualearner couples manage childcare during a crisis situation when the
typical fallbacks are not available. The results suggest that, even in

the context of an unprecedented crisis when the spheres of work
and home were overlapping for men and women, gendered patterns of childcare responsibilities persist. It has been argued that
the conditions of the pandemic offered an opportunity for fathers
to engage more fully with their family roles and to shift the balance
in gender role expectations. Instead, the data presented here suggest that the burden of intensive, unexpected, and ongoing childcare responsibilities is disproportionately falling on mothers. Yet
when parents did create more novel and egalitarian strategies for
managing childcare in the crisis, particularly by alternating work
days, their performance and well-being were preserved. Such
novel solutions may be precisely those that help families and
organizations move forward in a post-COVID reality.

Other Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White,
Other (please describe), Prefer not to disclose]
• How many children do you have under 18 that primarily
reside in your home?
• How many children do you have under 6 that primarily
reside in your home?
• What is your annual income?

Plan for Managing Childcare and Work Commitments
The following set of questions ask about you and your spouse’s
plan for managing work and family responsibilities during the
COVID-19 outbreak
• What is you and your spouse’s plan for dealing with both
of your work commitments during the upcoming period
when your normal childcare is disrupted? Please be as
detailed as possible.

• How will you have to adjust your work role during this
time?
• How will your spouse have to adjust his/her work role
during this time?

Implementation of Plan
We previously asked you about you and your spouse’s plan for
dealing with both of your work commitments during the pandemic
when your normal childcare was disrupted. You stated your plan
was [insert text with participant’s response at Time 1].
• We’d like you to rate how well you followed that plan.
That is, on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is “did not follow the
plan at all” and 10 is followed “the plan perfectly”, where
do you fall?

Family Cohesion
Indicate to what extent you agree with the following statements.
In thinking about your family during this time . . .
