The authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive
symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the
United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults
from RAND Corporation’s nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between
April–June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April,
2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the
pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction
decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and
a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower
education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in
well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life
satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on
conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key
mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during
COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not
provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from
before to during COVID-19.

role of socioeconomic status (SES; i.e., an individual’s objective
social or economic position in relation to others) during the
COVID-19 pandemic has been scrutinized. For example, individuals of lower SES were more likely to be frontline workers with
higher potential exposure to the virus (Afridi & Block, 2020). In
contrast, individuals of higher SES were more likely to be working
or furloughed at home with comforts such as a well-stocked
pantry, stable Internet, and spacious living arrangements (Reeves
& Rothwell, 2020). Despite these differences, a national poll by
Axios-Ipsos reported that 47% of Americans of higher SES indicated their emotional well-being had gotten worse because of the
pandemic, compared to only 34% of lower SES individuals (Talev,
2020).
The first purpose of this study is to examine levels of psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction)
during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United
States in general and by SES. We surveyed 1,143 adults from
RAND Corporation’s nationally representative American Life
Panel during the first U.S. peak of the pandemic in April, 2020.
We compare levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic
to pre-COVID population norms (Tomitaka et al., 2018). Our
second purpose is to assess within-person changes in well-being
(i.e., changes in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from
before to during the pandemic—in general and by SES. Finally,

SES AND WELL-BEING DURING COVID-19

Hobfoll, 1989, 2010) and the theory of fundamental social causes
(Link & Phelan, 1995), we examine four resource-based mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being
levels and changes. We operationalize SES as educational attainment and household income. These are “objective and quantifiable
indicators of power, prestige, and control over resources” (Diemer,
Mistry, Wadsworth, López, & Reimers, 2013, p. 84). These two
distinct facets of SES have incremental predictive validity, with
education being more specific to human capital and income being
more specific to material capital (Oakes & Rossi, 2003).
Our study provides several contributions to the literature. Despite being fundamental aspects of work, educational attainment
and income have received scarce attention in industrialorganizational psychology and management research (Côté, 2011;
Leana & Meuris, 2015). We present unique nationally representative data about well-being changes from before to during COVID19, and test mechanisms underlying differential well-being outcomes for individuals of lower and higher SES. Due to the
difficulty of accessing representative samples during crises with
measures for comparison before the event, most studies of crisis
events include convenience samples and only postevent assessments of well-being (Norris et al., 2002). From a theoretical
standpoint, our study addresses the need to better understand the
pathways that affect well-being changes for individuals of lower
and higher SES amid public health crises (Galama & van Kippersluis, 2019). From a practical standpoint, organizational practices
can perpetuate and are also impacted by socioeconomic inequality
(Bapuji, Ertug, & Shaw, 2020). It is thus informative for managerial practice to elucidate the relationship between SES, well-being,
and transmitting mechanisms (Christie & Barling, 2009). Further,
efforts to minimize risk for reduced well-being during the
COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises are best
informed if there is an understanding of the processes that stimulate reduced well-being (Link & Phelan, 1995).

Theory and Hypothesis Development
COR theory is a leading psychological theory of stress and
trauma (Hobfoll, Tirone, Holmgreen, & Gerhart, 2016). According
to the theory, humans acquire and safeguard resources to protect
themselves and to ease the challenges of daily life. Resources
include valued conditions or situations, personal resources such as
self-efficacy, and material or energy resources such as money
(Hobfoll, 1989). A first tenet of this theory suggests that when
individuals lose or fear losing valued resources, well-being is
negatively affected (Hobfoll, 1989, 2010). This reduction in wellbeing stems from both the instrumental and symbolic value of the
lost resources.
COVID-19, recognized as a worldwide pandemic by the World
Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, was associated
with myriad resource losses for individuals. Millions of employees
were furloughed or laid off from their jobs, or began working
under new conditions at home or on site. Childcare center and
school closures changed family routines. Supply chain interruptions reduced the availability of everyday supplies. Services, such
as grooming, physical therapy, public transportation, and many
entertainment options became unavailable or limited. Individuals

1383

were isolated from friends and family. Stock markets plummeted
in late March, 2020, producing financial loss and fear of further
loss.
Consistent with COR theory, mental health concerns have been
documented in countries that experienced the COVID-19 outbreak
before the United States (Qiu et al., 2020). For example, of 52,730
individuals surveyed in China during the pandemic, 35% indicated
experiencing psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020). Another
study from China reported that the prevalence of depression was
14.6% in a convenience sample (Lei et al., 2020). While such data
is informative, within-person comparisons of well-being from before to during COVID-19 are required to assess whether wellbeing levels have decreased and the effect size of this decrease. In
addition to comparing levels of depressive symptoms during the
pandemic in the United States to established norms, we also
examine within-person changes in both depressive symptoms and
life satisfaction from before to during the pandemic. We propose:
Hypothesis 1: Depressive symptoms assessed during the pandemic will be significantly higher than previous population
norms.
Hypothesis 2: Individuals will portray (a) an increase in depressive symptoms and (b) a decrease in life satisfaction from
before to during the pandemic.

SES and Well-Being During the Pandemic
According to COR theory, SES is fundamentally linked to the
availability of resources (Hobfoll, 2010). Individuals with higher
education and income have more resources and are better able to
protect the resources they have (Hobfoll, 2010). In contrast, low
SES makes it difficult to garner resources, even obstructing the
protection of one’s resources. Consistent with the COR theory
premise that people with fewer resources will have lower psychological health, lower SES is associated with more depression
(Lorant et al., 2003; Wang, Schmitz, & Dewa, 2010) and lower life
satisfaction (Pinquart & Sörensen, 2000).
The theory of fundamental social causes specifies that the role
of SES in health is so robust and enduring that it is imperative to
examine SES inequities and the mechanisms behind these inequities (Phelan, Link, & Tehranifar, 2010). While many resources fit
under the umbrella of COR theory, the theory of fundamental
social causes identifies four key resources underlying SES inequities (Link & Phelan, 1995). First, perceived financial resources
refer to perceived fit between accessible material resources and
financial needs and wants (Meuris & Leana, 2018). In general,
individuals of lower SES worry more about their financial situation and feel more overwhelmed by their financial obligations than
individuals of higher SES (Link & Phelan, 1995). Yet, the same
level of income may indicate comfort for one and discomfort for
another, stemming from divergent financial responsibilities or
expenditures (Leana & Meuris, 2015). Second, SES is related to
lower levels of power. While power broadly refers to the ability to
administer outcomes such as rewards and punishment (Hinkin &
Schriesheim, 1989; Raven, 1993), SES is especially related to
perceived control over life outcomes, with low SES typically
signifying “a sense that one’s actions are chronically influenced by
external forces outside of one’s individual control and influence”
(Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, & Keltner, 2012, p.

549). Resources and contexts accompanying lower SES result in
more disruption to both perceived and actual control over life
constraints (Kraus et al., 2012). Third, interpersonal resources
refer to having higher levels of social support, social integration, or
connectedness (Link & Phelan, 1995). Lower SES is related to
smaller social networks and more social isolation and loneliness
(Algren et al., 2020; House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988). Lastly,
knowledge refers to possessing facts or information that allow an
accurate awareness of a topic. In general, individuals of lower SES
have less health-related knowledge (Phelan et al., 2010). Supporting this idea, research early in the COVID-19 crisis found lower
COVID-related knowledge among individuals of lower SES (Cutler, Stantcheva, Alsan, & Yang, 2020).
Each of these resources is important to the maintenance of
well-being. Specifically, individuals with lower perceived financial resources have lower levels of mental health and life satisfaction stemming from deleterious cognitive energy devoted to fear
and discontent about their situation (Meuris & Leana, 2018).
Lower sense of control is related to lower well-being because
individuals feel powerless about their decisions and influence over
others (Anderson, Kraus, Galinsky, & Keltner, 2012; Cheng,
Cheung, Chio, & Chan, 2013). With respect to interpersonal resources, social isolation—which can contribute to individuals feeling a lack of support and interpersonal connections— has been
associated with risk of depressive symptoms (Teo, Choi, & Valenstein, 2013). Knowledge has been shown to be related to higher
levels of physical health—individuals with more health-related
knowledge know how to stay healthy (Phelan et al., 2010). The
relationship between knowledge and psychological well-being is
more ambiguous. In the case of COVID-19, there have been
indications that higher satisfaction with knowledge about the virus
is related to lower depression (Wang et al., 2020), perhaps because
individuals feel efficacious about precautionary measures. Higher
consumption of news during a pandemic may reduce psychological well-being, however, perhaps because it amplifies fear and
awareness of suffering (Ornell, Schuch, Sordi, & Kessler, 2020).
Indeed, the WHO urged individuals to “minimize watching, reading, or listening to news about COVID-19 that causes you to feel
anxious or distressed” (WHO, 2020, p.1). We posit:
Hypothesis 3: SES will be (a) negatively associated with
depressive symptoms and (b) positively associated with life
satisfaction during the pandemic.
Hypothesis 4: SES will be positively associated with (a)
perceived financial resources, (b) perceived control, (c) interpersonal resources, and (d) COVID-related knowledge and
news consumption during the pandemic. These resources will
mediate the relationship between SES and depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during the pandemic.

SES and Changes of Well-Being From Before to
During COVID-19
The previous hypotheses do not address whether or how wellbeing might differentially change for individuals of lower and
higher SES from before to during COVID-19. Another aspect of
COR theory suggests individuals of lower SES may be more likely
to experience a greater decline in well-being during a crisis event

in comparison to those of higher SES. Specifically, COR theory
suggests that individuals with compromised resources are most
vulnerable to additional resource loss. In contrast, individuals with
higher SES are more likely to have plentiful resource caravans that
can be drawn upon to stave off negative emotions and cognitions,
and assist overall coping (Hobfoll, 2010). While few studies have
examined SES and well-being in the context of crises with pre and
post measures (Norris et al., 2002), a few studies support the
premise that people with lower SES have the largest decrease in
well-being after a crisis (Ginexi, Weihs, Simmens, & Hoyt, 2000;
Phifer, 1990). For example, following the 1984 Kentucky flood,
individuals of lower SES reported greater increases in depression
and anxiety (Phifer, 1990).
In contrast to these findings, as mentioned in our opening paragraph, a nationally representative survey of 1,355 U.S. adults early in
the pandemic found that more individuals of higher SES indicated
their emotional well-being had gotten worse than individuals of lower
SES (Talev, 2020). Although counterintuitive, situationally specific
lower well-being among individuals who typically have more resources is also acknowledged by COR theory. Reduced well-being
depends on how one’s unique resources contract in a specific situation
(Hobfoll, 2010; Hobfoll, Johnson, Ennis, & Jackson, 2003). It is
possible that loss of resources during COVID-19 may have occurred
differentially for individuals of higher and lower SES. For example,
higher SES could have been associated with greater loss of interpersonal resources, given that individuals of higher SES were more likely
to be newly working at home during the pandemic than those of lower
SES. Or, given individuals lower in SES already tend to have low
perceived control, individuals of higher SES may have had a relatively bigger drop in perceived control due to COVID-19-related
uncertainties. Considering the above, we propose the following competing hypotheses:
Hypothesis 5a: There will be a larger increase in depressive
symptoms and a larger decrease in life satisfaction from
before to during COVID-19 for lower (vs. higher) SES
individuals.
Hypothesis 5b: There will be a larger increase in depressive
symptoms and a larger decrease in life satisfaction from
before to during COVID-19 for higher (vs. lower) SES
individuals.
Only limited research has empirically examined the role of differential resource loss in explaining SES differences in well-being
change (Kiviruusu, Huurre, Haukkala, & Aro, 2013). A given crisis
can affect resources differentially for individuals of higher and lower
SES (Warr & Aung, 2019). Data available from a previous assessment of the American Life Panel allowed us to assess actual changes
from before to during COVID-19 in two of the resources central to
our theorizing: perceived control and interpersonal resources (Link &
Phelan, 1995). We examine whether decreases in perceived control
and interpersonal resources mediate the relationship between SES and
changes in well-being. We also examine whether lower levels of the
other resources during COVID-19 (perceived financial resources,
COVID-related knowledge, and COVID-related news consumption)
explain changes in well-being. Based on the components of both COR
theory and the theory of fundamental social causes, we propose:
Hypothesis 6: Declines in (a) perceived control and (b) interpersonal resources as well as levels of (c) perceived financial

Participants and Procedure
We surveyed the RAND American Life Panel (ALP; Pollard &
Baird, 2017), a probability-sample based, nationally representative
sample. Time 1 (T1) of our study took place before COVID-19 in
April–June, 2019 (“Adult Social Networks and Well Being,” RAND
Corporation IRB # 2017–1022), which focused on U.S. adults between ages 30 and 80. The before-COVID-19 data was collected as
part of a larger ongoing longitudinal study and the present article is the
first being published from this broader database. Time 2 (T2) data was
collected April 16 –19, 2020 (“Stressors and strains at work and home
during the Corona virus pandemic,” University of Minnesota IRB
# 00009402), during the first estimated 2020 peak of the pandemic in
the United States as measured by deaths per day and hospital resource
use (IHME, 2020). Perceived control, interpersonal resources, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction were assessed at both T1 and T2.
Perceived financial resources, COVID-related knowledge, and
COVID-related news consumption were assessed at T2 and were not
available at T1. ALP panelists are invited to update demographic and
general health status three times a year. An invitation to our study was
sent to 1,771 panelists who completed the T1 survey; 1,143 responded
(64.5%).1 Demographic data for the sample is shown in Table 1.

Measures

Note. Frequencies listed in this table are unweighted. Household income
does not total to 1,143 due to missing responses. Respondents were or had
previously been employed (e.g., retired, unemployed) in a wide range of
occupations, with the three most frequent being education (14%), managerial (10%), and office and administrative (9%).

resources and (d) COVID-related knowledge and COVIDrelated news consumption will mediate the relationship between SES and changes in depressive symptoms and life
satisfaction from before to during the pandemic.

The complete list of items in each measure is included in the
Appendix. Socioeconomic status was measured with (a) educational
attainment assessed in early 2020 and (b) annual household income
assessed in 2019 and 2020, averaged across these two assessments.
Respondents reported their highest level of education on a 9-point
scale (1 ⫽ less than high school, 9 ⫽ doctorate degree). There was a
.98 and above correlation between education used in our analyses and
four previous measurements, providing evidence for the reliability of
this measure in this sample. Household income represents the total
combined income of all family members 15 years or older who lived
in the household over the past year on a 17-point scale (1 ⫽ less than
$5,000, 17 ⫽ $200,000 or above). Combining multiple recent years of
household income is recommended because household income can
change from year to year, especially for individuals of lower SES
(Diemer et al., 2013).2
Perceived financial resources were measured by four items (Meuris
& Leana, 2018) on a 5-point scale (1 ⫽ never to 5 ⫽ always). Higher
scores reflect more satisfaction with, and less worry about, one’s
financial resources. Perceived control was measured with seven items
(Lachman & Weaver, 1998) on a 4-point scale (1 ⫽ strongly disagree

Respondents and nonrespondents did not significantly differ in general
health status, education, and income. Respondents were older and were
more likely to be male and non-Hispanic White. Sampling weights were
included to adjust for differences between our sample and the general
population, and age, gender, and racioethnicity are included in analyses as
covariates.

Some researchers use occupational prestige as an index of SES among
working samples. Among our participants working full or part time in early
2020, Nam-Powers-Boyd occupational prestige scale scores (Boyd & Nam,
2015) were highly correlated with education (r ⫽ .51, p ⬍ .01) and income
(r ⫽ .58, p ⬍ .01).

to 4 ⫽ strongly agree). Interpersonal resources were assessed with
three items from the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Hughes, Waite,
Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004) on a 3-point scale (1 ⫽ hardly ever to
3 ⫽ often). This scale is strongly correlated with a longer version (r ⫽
.82; Hughes et al., 2004). Higher scores reflect more interpersonal
resources. COVID-related knowledge (1 ⫽ not at all knowledgeable
to 5 ⫽ extremely knowledgeable for knowledge) and news consumption (1 ⫽ never to 5 ⫽ a great deal) were assessed with single items
on 5-point scales.
Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009), on a 4-point scale
(0 ⫽ not at all to 3 ⫽ nearly every day). The sum of item responses
indicates the overall level of depressive symptoms. The PHQ-8 has
a high 48-hr test–retest reliability and construct validity as a
diagnostic measure (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001; Kroenke
et al., 2009). Life satisfaction was assessed with a single item (1 ⫽
very dissatisfied to 10 ⫽ very satisfied; Kobau, Sniezek, Zack,
Lucas, & Burns, 2010). This item is strongly correlated (r ⫽ .75;
Kobau et al., 2010) with the multi-item Satisfaction with Life
Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985).
Control variables included age, racioethnicity (four dummy
variables with non-Hispanic White as the referent category, compared to non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander,
and Others; 0 ⫽ no, 1 ⫽ yes), gender (0 ⫽ male, 1 ⫽ female), and
general health status (1 ⫽ poor to 5 ⫽ excellent). Age and general
health status were controlled because they are risk factors for
COVID-19 (Bhargava et al., 2020; Mayo Clinic, 2020). Racioethnicity was controlled because racial disparities exist in health
outcomes above and beyond SES differences (House & Williams,
2000). We controlled for gender because meta-analytic findings
suggest there are more depressive symptoms among women than
men (d ⫽ 0.27; Salk, Hyde, & Abramson, 2017).3

Analytic Strategy
Weights were incorporated in the estimation of coefficients and
standard errors (SEs) in order to account for sampling bias (Asparouhov, 2005).4 We tested Hypothesis 1 (H1) using a one-sample
t test and Hypothesis 2 (H2) using a paired-sample t test, with
SPSS Version 24. To test Hypothesis 3 (H3) and Hypothesis 4
(H4) we used structural equation modeling (SEM). To test Hypothesis 5 (H5) and Hypothesis 6 (H6), we used latent change
score (LCS) modeling. In analyses for H3–H6 latent factors were
specified for multiple-indicator variables (see McArdle, 2009) and
the analyses were conducted in Mplus Version 8.3 (Muthén &
Muthén, 2017). We used the Monte Carlo method to construct
95% confidence intervals (CIs) of indirect and total effects in R

When control variables are removed, results are all consistent except
for the effect of income on COVID-related news consumption and the
direct effect of education on depressive symptoms, which were not significant. Detailed results are available on this study’s OSF site (https://doi

which also allowed us to utilize the sampling weights.

Results
Preliminary Analyses Results
Means, standard deviations (SDs), correlations, and alphas
for study variables are shown in Table 2. For the repeatedly
measured multiple-item scales (i.e., perceived control, interpersonal resources, and depressive symptoms), a confirmatory
factor analysis model with time-varying factor loadings did not
fit the data significantly better than a model with fixed factor
loadings (Satorra-Bentler scaled ⌬␹2 ⫽ 22.16, ⌬df ⫽ 15, p ⬎
.05), supporting measurement equivalence of these scales at T1
and T2.

H1 and H2 Results
Using population norms from Tomitaka et al. (2018), onesample t test results showed that depressive symptoms during the
COVID-19 pandemic (M ⫽ 4.77, SD ⫽ 4.83) were higher than
population norms before the pandemic (M ⫽ 3.16; t ⫽ 11.28, df ⫽
1142, p ⬍ .01, Cohen’s d ⫽ .33; see Table 3). Therefore, H1 was
supported. Using a paired-sample t test, results showed that depressive symptoms increased from before (M ⫽ 4.18, SD ⫽ 4.60)
to during COVID-19 (M ⫽ 4.77, SD ⫽ 4.83; t ⫽ 4.55, df ⫽ 1142,
p ⬍ .01, Cohen’s d ⫽ .13), supporting H2a. Life satisfaction
decreased from before (M ⫽ 7.76, SD ⫽ 1.79) to during
COVID-19 (M ⫽ 7.12, SD ⫽ 1.90; t ⫽ 12.52, df ⫽ 1115, p ⬍ .01,
Cohen’s d ⫽ .38), supporting H2b.

H3 and H4 Results
We specified a model that included the effects of education
and income on the mediators, which in turn had effects on
depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during COVID-19.

As reported in Table 4, the model explained 62% and 49% of
the variance in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during
COVID-19, respectively. Estimates of indirect effects (to test
H4) and total effects (to test H3) are reported in Table 5. In
contrast to expectations for H3, education had a positive, rather
than negative, total effect on depressive symptoms during
COVID-19 (total effect ⫽ .040, 95% CI [.022, .060]; H3a) and
a negative, rather than positive, total effect on life satisfaction
during COVID-19 (total effect ⫽ ⫺.169, 95% CI [⫺.221, ⫺.116];
H3b). Consistent with expectations for H3, income had a negative total effect on depressive symptoms (total effect ⫽ ⫺.014,
95% CI [⫺.026, ⫺.002]; H3a) and a positive total effect on life
satisfaction (total effect ⫽ .055, 95% CI [.024, .086]; H3b).
With regard to H4, education was positively related to COVIDrelated knowledge (␤ ⫽ .07, SE ⫽ .03, p ⬍ .01), but COVIDrelated knowledge was not a significant mediator of the relationships between education and depressive symptoms and life
satisfaction (see Table 5). Income was positively related to
perceived financial resources (␤ ⫽ .06, SE ⫽ .01, p ⬍ .01),
perceived control (␤ ⫽ .01, SE ⫽ .00, p ⬍ .05), interpersonal
resources (␤ ⫽ .02, SE ⫽ .01, p ⬍ .05), and COVID-related
news consumption (␤ ⫽ .03, SE ⫽ .01, p ⬍ .05). Each of these
resources mediated the relationship between income and depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during COVID-19 (see
Table 5). Overall, H4a– d received partial support with regard to
income but not education.

Maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (MLR)
was used to incorporate weights into our analyses. The MLR method is not
compatible with bootstrapping by resampling cases (which is the default
bootstrapping procedure in Mplus). Therefore, we used the Monte Carlo
method, which resamples estimates of parameters from sampling distributions, to construct 95% CIs of indirect and total effects (MacKinnon,
Lockwood, & Williams, 2004).

H5 and H6 Results
We specified a LCS model including the effects of education
and income on perceived financial resources during COVID-19,
change in perceived control and interpersonal resources, and
COVID-related knowledge and news consumption, which in turn
had effects on changes in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. As shown in Table 6, the model explained 28% and 21% of
the variance in changes in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, respectively. A latent change score represents the difference
between T1 and T2 (T2 ⫽ T1 ⫹ change).6 A positive (negative)
coefficient of a predictor on a latent change score means a higher
level of the predictor is associated with a larger increase (decrease)
in the outcome.
Estimates of indirect effects (to test H6) and total effects (to test
H5) of education and income on changes in depressive symptoms
and life satisfaction are reported in Table 7. Of our competing
hypotheses, H5a was not supported. In partial support of H5b,
individuals with higher (vs. lower) education reported a larger
increase in depressive symptoms (total effect ⫽ .032, 95% CI
[.014, .049]) and a larger decrease in life satisfaction (total effect ⫽ ⫺.094, 95% CI [⫺.137, ⫺.042]) from before to during
COVID-19. Income did not have significant total effects on
changes in depressive symptoms or life satisfaction. Among the
mediators hypothesized in H6, three had significant effects (see
Table 7). Mediated by COVID-related knowledge, higher educa-

tion was associated with a larger increase in life satisfaction (H6d),
although overall higher education was associated with a larger
decrease in life satisfaction. Mediated by perceived financial resources, higher income was associated with a larger increase in life
satisfaction (H6c). However, mediated by COVID-related news
consumption, higher income was associated with a larger decrease
in life satisfaction (H6d). In other words, these two mediators of
income operated in opposite directions, with financial resources
contributing to an increase and COVID-related news consumption
contributing to a decrease in life satisfaction.

Additional Findings
First, results from the null LCS model for within-person changes
in well-being show additional support for H2. There was a significant increase in depressive symptoms (␣ ⫽ .09, SE ⫽ .03, p ⬍
.01) and a significant decrease in life satisfaction (␣ ⫽ ⫺.65, SE ⫽
.08, p ⬍ .01) from before to during COVID-19. Second, while
changes in resources did not substantially explain the differences
in well-being change for individuals of higher and lower SES, they
did for the sample in general (see Table 6). For example, individuals who experienced a reduction in perceived control and interpersonal resources experienced a larger increase in depressive

symptoms. Finally, as a supplemental analysis we examined the
quadratic effects of education and income on the mediators and
well-being. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, we found a significant
curvilinear relationship between education and depressive symptoms during COVID-19 (␤ ⫽ ⫺.01, SE ⫽ .01, p ⬍ .05), and
between income and change in life satisfaction from before to
during COVID-19 (␤ ⫽ ⫺.01, SE ⫽ .00, p ⬍ .01). Figure 2
portrays alternative support for H5b, for income. Education and
income did not have significant curvilinear effects on the mediators. Full tables for the results in Figures 1 and 2 are hosted on the

Discussion
A nationally representative sample in the United States displayed an increase in depressive symptoms and a decrease in life
satisfaction from before to during COVID-19. Levels of depressive
symptoms during COVID-19 were also higher than previously
established norms (Tomitaka et al., 2018).
Contributing to the important goal of illustrating how the pandemic is affecting individuals of lower and higher SES, our study
showed that during the first peak of the pandemic in the United
States, higher education was positively associated with depressive
symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction. This
was contrary to expectations because individuals with lower SES
generally have lower well-being. Consistent with expectations,
higher income was associated with lower depressive symptoms
and higher life satisfaction during the pandemic.
Assessment of change from before to during the pandemic is
important to diagnose how the pandemic affected well-being.
Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in
depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction
from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower
education. Income did not have linear relationship with changes in
well-being, but supplemental analysis supported a curvilinear relationship showing that individuals at higher levels of income
experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to
during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income
(see Figure 2).
These findings provide a partial replication of the AxiosIpsos poll, which indicated that in the United States, a higher
proportion of higher SES individuals reported a decline in their
emotional well-being due to the pandemic than those of lower
SES (Talev, 2020). A major difference between our study and
the Axios-Ipsos poll (beyond our use of comparison data from
before the pandemic) is their use of an income and education
composite to index SES. Income and education capture different parts of SES and can result in divergent empirical findings
(e.g., Christie & Barling, 2009; DeGarmo, Forgatch, & Martinez, 1999), which we also reveal in this study.
We examined four resource-based mechanisms to try to explain
how SES may transmit to lower and reduced well-being. Tested
mediators did not provide good explanatory value, especially for
the effect of education. The one significant mediator, COVIDrelated knowledge, contributed to an increase in life satisfaction
from before to during COVID-19, rather than a decrease. As such,
COVID-related knowledge was not a valuable explanatory mech-

Note. N ⫽ 1,143. SES ⫽ socioeconomic status. Racioethnicity is coded as four dummy variables with non-Hispanic White as the referent category. Age,
general health status, education, and income were mean centered. SEs are reported inside the parentheses. When only education was included as a predictor,
it had significant positive effects on perceived financial resources during COVID, COVID-related knowledge, COVID-related news consumption, and
change in depressive symptoms, and had a significant negative effect on change in life satisfaction. When only income was included as a predictor, it had
significant positive effects on perceived financial resources during COVID and COVID-related news consumption, and significant negative effect on change
in life satisfaction but was not significantly related to change in depressive symptoms. All the effects of the mediators on the outcomes remained the same

anism to explain why individuals with more education displayed
an overall well-being decline. Further insight is thus needed. In
supplemental analyses, education was not associated with job loss
due to COVID-19, r ⫽ ⫺.06, p ⬎ .05. We also added having
experienced job loss (furloughed or laid off) due to COVID-19 as
another control variable. Results were consistent with or without
this control. An unmeasured explanation is the increase in work
responsibility that individuals of higher education may have encountered. The pandemic meant that many managers had to lead
their business units and teams through staffing changes such as
layoffs or pay cuts, producing substantial stress (Knight, 2020).
Further, educational attainment is a key predictor of participation
in the stock market (Cooper & Zhu, 2016), which represents a
nuanced aspect of financial resources that our measure might not
have fully captured. In the few weeks preceding our T2 assessment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost one third of its total
value (S&P Dow Jones Indices, 2020), which may have contributed to a greater loss of wealth (and fear of loss) among individuals
with higher levels of education.
Finally, it is plausible that individuals of higher SES experience
adaptation or an endowment effect whereby they have a higher
expectation for a constant availability of resources (including ones
not incorporated in our theorizing), and therefore experience
greater declines in well-being when a crisis contracts or threatens
their resource supplies (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2002; Tversky &

Kahneman, 1991). This possible explanation is particularly intriguing given that evidence suggests that the pandemic has hit
individuals of lower SES very hard. As one of many examples of
higher impacts to lower SES individuals, household crowding and
higher odds of working on-site have been linked to higher rates of
COVID-19 infections (Emeruwa et al., 2020; Oppel, Gebeloff, Lai,
Wright, & Smith, 2020).
Our study assessed well-being early in the pandemic and it is
possible that the findings of more severe well-being decline among
individuals of higher SES are temporary. Future research should
examine well-being among groups of higher and lower SES over
a longer time during the pandemic as well as moderators of the
impact of education (e.g., personality traits). For organizational
and managerial practice, as well as mental health practitioners, it
will be key to identify the groups for whom the impacts are longer
lasting in order to address inequities. It would also be intriguing to
examine if our findings replicate in other countries, to consider the
role of threat of loss versus actual loss of resources, and to theorize
the role of factors such as age and general health as more central
predictors of psychological well-being during COVID.
There are several unique aspects to our investigation. Available
pre–post studies of SES in the context of other crises have relied
on data following versus during the event (Norris et al., 2002). Our
study also expands collective knowledge by examining the role of
resources in explaining SES differences in levels and changes in

well-being during a crisis event. An additional major strength of
our study is that it features a probability sample-based, nationally
representative panel. This broad sampling strategy was essential to
represent both low and high levels of SES, and to provide a more
rigorous test of our hypotheses.
We contribute to the conversation on socioeconomic inequality
by illuminating how a crisis event afflicts well-being across the
SES spectrum. The theory of fundamental social causes has primarily been examined with respect to physical health. Our study
extends this theory to the examination of psychological well-being.
We found more support for this theory with respect to income as
an SES indicator than for education. Moreover, our study contrib-

utes to the dynamic testing of COR theory, which emphasizes the
velocity of loss spirals underlying chronic resource shortages and
suggests the primacy of acute resource losses (Ennis, Hobfoll, &
Schröder, 2000; Hobfoll, 2010). Our findings provide some support for both of these tenets. We found inferior well-being during
the pandemic among individuals with lower income and also
observed well-being declines to a greater extent among individuals
of higher education. Future research is needed to distinguish between the relative impact of chronic resource shortages and acute
resource losses. We also invite more managerial research delineating how SES contexts shape psychological experiences in the
face of societal and organizational crises (Bapuji, Patel, Ertug, &
Allen, 2020; Fiske & Markus, 2012).
As a limitation, our sample focused on individuals who participated in the Adult Social Networks and Well Being study that
targeted U.S. adults between 30 and 80 years old. Future research
can examine whether our results generalize to those under the age
of 30. It is also important to qualify our inferences about
COVID-19 per se being the definitive cause of well-being changes
from 2019 to 2020. These dynamics may plausibly be explained by
other factors that are not associated with the pandemic, such as the
political environment. The consistent timing of well-being assessments in 2019 and 2020 mostly rule out alternative explanations
related to seasonal effects.
