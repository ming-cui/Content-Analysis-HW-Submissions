An immense amount of work has investigated how adverse situations affect anxiety using chronic (i.e.,
average) or episodic conceptualizations. However, less attention has been paid to circumstances that
unfold continuously over time, inhibiting theoretical testing and leading to possible erroneous conclusions about how stressors are dynamically appraised across time. Because stressor novelty, predictability,
and patterns are central components of appraisal theories, we use the COVID-19 crisis as a context to
illustrate how variation in the phenomenon’s patterns of change (specifically, total cases [average level]
but also the rate of linear [velocity] and nonlinear growth [acceleration] in cases) influence anxiety. We
also show the implications of anxiety for next-day functioning at work. These effects are tested in data
drawn from a sample of employed adults in a daily diary study conducted in four overlapping waves. The
data span the emergence, exponential rise, and initial tapering of the virus in the United States (February
10, 2020 to April 28, 2020). Our results show that although the impact of level of COVID-19 cases on
anxiety decreases over time, the effect of change in cases (velocity and acceleration) increases over time.
Anxiety is then associated with next-day work functioning (engagement, performance, and emotional
exhaustion).

stances it arises from are ambiguous, ongoing, and have no clear
way out (Lazarus, 1991a). The COVID-19 pandemic is a grim but
illustrative anxiety-inducing stressor; an uncertain and ongoing
threat that cannot be resolved via avoidance or escape. That is,
whereas individual coping strategies are possible (e.g., social distancing), the spread of the virus at a state level is still beyond any
given individual’s control, which can inhibit coping and selfregulatory processing (Cheng & McCarthy, 2018).
However, there are differing perspectives as to what particular
features of an ongoing stressor might give rise to anxiety, and how
these effects unfold over time. Situations can evolve temporally in
complex ways; for example, a situation can be grim but improving, or
mild but deteriorating. In addition, arguments have been made both
for individuals feeling less anxious with continued exposure to a
stressor (Diener & Diener, 1996; Selye, 1976; Suh et al., 1996), as
well as the opposite (Hobfoll, 1989; McEwen, 1998; also see Ritter et
al., 2016). A resolution to these conflicting arguments can emerge
from a more nuanced perspective of how stressors are experienced.
To date, theoretical insights come mostly from either chronic or
episodic views of the focal stressor (Sonnentag & Frese, 2012). The
former discusses the effects of stable features of one’s life (e.g., life
with chronic pain; employment in a high risk occupation; Craig &
Jacobsen, 1984; Eckenrode, 1984; Kanner et al., 1981) while the latter
relates to how particular stressful events might lead to anxiety (e.g.,
role overload on a given day, a negative interaction with a supervisor;
Anshel, 2000; Barling, 1990; Restubog et al., 2011). Although providing invaluable insights, the underlying conceptualizations of stressors are, to some extent, deficient.

March 13th, 2020: We’re waiting until an announcement is made
about coronavirus. Nobody is really working, just mass panicking.
April 24th, 2020: I am concerned that with the economy opening back
up so soon that we may see a surge in COVID-19 cases . . . that would
only set us back in our fight. . . . You would see an increase in
numbers if it gets out of hand like it did in the beginning stages.
Numbers are just starting to go down.

A substantial amount of research has investigated how exposure
to stressors influences affect and, ultimately, attitudes and behaviors (Brief & Weiss, 2002; Lazarus, 1991a; Lazarus & Folkman,
1984; Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996). Although many negative affective reactions to stressors are possible, exposure to stressors
characterized by uncertainty and existential threat lead specifically
to anxiety (Lazarus, 1991a). Anxiety is a pernicious state, as it is
persistent, irresolvable, and consumes attentional and cognitive
resources, thus inhibiting individuals’ functioning (Kagan, 1972).
It is unique in that it is anticipatory (future-looking), and has no
action tendencies except for avoidance or escape, as the circum-

ANXIETY AND DYNAMIC STRESSORS

Chronic views fail to consider that situations can vary over time.
For example, one person with a chronic heavy workload may
experience days of higher or lower workload whereas another’s
experience may be more stable. Episodic conceptualizations recognize such variation in events, however, they seldom take into
account that such events do not occur in a vacuum. Rather,
experienced events are seen within the lens of past experience,
something referred to as past as prologue (Rosen et al., 2020).
Because events can persist, deteriorate, or improve over time, it is
necessary to assess trajectories—patterns of change over time. For
example, a person’s experiences with their leader in the workplace
might involve acts of abuse represented by a few severe episodes
that wane in frequency and severity over time, while another
person’s experience might be represented by a steady level of
infrequent episodes. These two situations represent different temporal contexts and, as a result, they should affect individuals
differently. However, neither chronic nor episodic conceptualizations would capture and explain them adequately.
In the COVID-19 pandemic, employees are continuously experiencing a severe stressor, but, importantly, are doing so in different patterns that themselves vary over time. These patterns of
change can be conceptualized as both velocity (i.e., rate of change,
positive or negative), and acceleration (i.e., change in velocity—
whether the rate of change is increasing [positive] or decreasing
[negative]; Carver & Scheier, 1990). For example, deteriorating
health, marked by increasing symptoms of illness (positive velocity), may be anxiety-inducing on its own, yet whether this velocity
is stable (symptoms increasing at a constant rate) or changing
(increase getting faster or slower) can lead to distinct affective
reactions (see Figure 1 for an illustration and expanded explanation). The same is true for the COVID-19 crisis; the news is
full of information about different patterns of change quantified
by metrics including the total number of confirmed cases, the

49

daily increase in cases, and the degree of exponential growth
(i.e., growth estimates and trajectory dashboards; calls to “flatten the curve”). These discrete metrics point to distinct ways in
which things are getting better or worse—an increase of thousands of cases may portend dire outcomes by signifying record
or exponential growth on a given day, whereas on a later day the
same increase may be positive development if it signifies a
flatter curve.
The effect of COVID-19-related stress on levels of general state
anxiety over time should thus be conceptualized as a holistic
pattern of continuing experience, not just chronic (i.e., average) or
episodic effects. Grasping the various patterns of change across
anxiety-inducing events can help clarify effects of the pandemic on
workplace functioning and also help illuminate the potential effect
of lesser, but more common, stressors that are experienced in a
similar way. Thus, this can offer important contributions to our
understanding of responses to stressors that emerge, fluctuate, or
vary over time (Ganster & Rosen, 2013; McGrath & Beehr, 1990).
Stressor characteristics such as predictability or novelty are a
central component of theories focusing on stressor responses
(Lazarus, 1991a; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). We specifically rely
on such a core perspective, the transactional model of stress
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) to discuss how various facets of the
COVID-19 crisis relate to general state anxiety over time. Importantly, we draw attention to integral but infrequently examined
parts of the model that address the dynamism of the stressor-strain
process (Lazarus, 1991a). We then integrate these with ideas of
stressor change over time derived from cybernetic (Edwards,
1992) and cognitive and affective processing (Ariely & Carmon,
2000; Watson, 2000) views. These frameworks suggest that
change (both velocity and acceleration) have meaningful consequences for state anxiety.

Exemplar Trajectories Considering Average Cases, Velocity, and Acceleration

Note. These exemplar trajectories show various combinations of average case levels, slopes, and curves. From left to right, they illustrate the following:
(a) a trajectory in which the confirmed cases range from 0 to 500 (low average cases), increasing at Day 1 (positive velocity), and this increase itself grows
(positive acceleration); (b) a situation in which the number of cases ranges from 700 to 3,700 (medium average cases), and the trajectory has a positive
linear change at baseline (positive velocity) but increases at a relatively constant rate over time (no acceleration); (c) a situation in which the number of
cases ranges from 50,000 to 190,000 (high average cases), and the trajectory is one in which the linear change at baseline is positive (positive velocity),
but this increase (change) decreases over time (negative acceleration). In other words, these exemplars represent relatively low, medium, and high positive
velocity coupled with positive, null, and negative acceleration, and low, medium, and high average cases, respectively.

Anxiety in Response to Stressor Exposure—A
Transactional Model View
The transactional model posits that stress responses emerge
from appraisal processes that begin when individuals experience a
stressor (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). During primary appraisal,
perceptions of elements of the focal stressor are used to determine
the degree of threat or harm that this stressor represents; during
secondary appraisal, individuals consider if and how they can
resolve the underlying stressor (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Lyon,
2000). Stress responses thus emerge only from situations appraised
as harmful and difficult to resolve; the particular response depends
on the appraisal (with anxiety, as noted, being a core response to
stressors characterized by existential threat and uncertainty). In
this work, we focus on primary appraisal, as resolution of the
COVID-19 crisis is outside any given individual’s control.
Importantly, the appraisal process is ongoing, and functioning
requires people to account for that, as “encounters with the environment are continually changing” (Lazarus, 1991a, p. 134). This
requires the appraisal processes to follow suit. Moreover, the
stressor features that are visible and important vary over time
(Lazarus, 1991a). Features signifying unpredictability, novelty,
change, or future implications, for example, demand more attention and are more important to appraisal (Lazarus & Folkman,
1984; Sapolsky, 1999). Integrating a holistic view of the dynamic
patterns in which a stressor unfolds over time can thus help clarify
its links to anxiety.

Characteristics of COVID as an Ongoing Stressor
The most straightforward characteristic of a stressor is its intensity (Bledow et al., 2011). However, in the current pandemic, there
are several other stressor characteristics including not only total
cases (intensity), but also dynamic features such as linear and
nonlinear change— daily increases, degree of exponential growth,
and so forth. Such stressor aspects have been oft discussed in other
parts of the literature. For example, cybernetic views (which the
transactional model is similar to; Edwards, 1992) provide insights
on how it is not only the level of a disturbance or discrepancy that
matters, but also its rate of change (velocity; Beck et al., 2017;
Howe et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013). Such views emerged from
work on how affect results from distance from an end state,
coupled with rates of movement toward or away from that state
(velocity), and increases or decreases in the latter (acceleration;
Carver & Scheier, 1990, 2000).
While these propositions were introduced primarily to measure
deviations between experienced and actual goal states, similar
ideas have emerged in other literatures involving situational judgments. For example, these views are discussed in the gestalt view
of situational perceptions (Ariely & Carmon, 2000), foundational
models on emotion emergence (Watson, 2000), as well as perhaps
more straightforward views in the subjective well-being literature
on the effects of whether things are getting better or worse (Sapolsky, 1999). They also speak to foundational characteristics of
the transactional model. Although less attention is paid to the
dynamic properties of stressors, this is not an omission of the
model itself: “What is important to remember is that the appraisal
of a chronic persistent event is not static; threat will fluctuate over
the course of an event as a function of coping and reappraisal

processes and as a function of changes in the environment”
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, p. 100). Such ideas were more formally encapsulated in discussions of how stressor unpredictability
and duration affect the appraisal process (Lazarus & Folkman,
1984). Thus, it is increasingly clear that a fuller understanding of
the effect of ongoing stressors on anxiety requires a more comprehensive conceptualization of stressors that go beyond simply
their level and also include ways in which they are growing or
speeding up over a given time frame. We therefore utilize each of
these criteria to outline a model of employee anxiety reactivity to
COVID-19, build theory about how that reactivity changes over
time, and how anxiety relates to important next-day work outcomes.

Hypothesis Development
As previously noted, anxiety is a response to experiencing a
threatening and potentially harmful stimulus that consumes attentional and cognitive resources (Kagan, 1972). Anxiety manifests
when “the uncertainty about what will happen and when obviates
any clear idea on the part of the person of what to do to prevent or
ameliorate it” (Lazarus, 1991a, p. 235). It is also an “anticipatory
emotion,” deriving out of contexts with no clear resolution or
escape (Lazarus, 1991b, p. 829). Whereas anxiety can manifest in
many ways, in this paper we will examine general state anxiety.
Such state anxiety is likely to emerge in a context like the
COVID-19 pandemic, which involves a shifting, unavoidable,
multifaceted threat beyond any individual’s control.
We posit that, in any given time point, this crisis can be
described using the (a) average level, (b) velocity, and (c) acceleration of the COVID-19 case number over the preceding days.
This information is available to individuals via the constant coverage of this phenomenon, and, as with previous events, they are
likely paying close attention (Althaus & Tewksbury, 2002; Boyle
et al., 2004; Casero-Ripollés, 2020; Chao et al., 2020; Heath &
Gay, 1997). As such, the appraisal process initiates as usual.
Moreover, this process will be ongoing as individuals try to make
sense of the daily changes in the crisis (Lazarus, 1991a; Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984).
More COVID-19 cases within one’s most relevant environment
(operationalized in this article as the U.S. state of residence) will
result in greater appraisals of threat.1 Not only do more cases
signify greater risk of one getting sick, but they might also portend
increased disturbances for both one’s personal life (i.e., family,
work, and other valued outcomes) as well as macro outcomes (e.g.,
economic turmoil). Combined, all these factors point to higher
levels of uncertainty and threat, leading to anxiety. Beyond averages, however, both velocity as well as acceleration of COVID-19
cases should also imply more unfavorable appraisals. Specifically,
the facts that the cases are increasing (positive velocity), and the
increases are speeding up (positive acceleration), point to a more
threatening development of the undesirable outcomes mentioned
above; simply put, the situation is getting worse. As anxiety is an
anticipatory emotion (Lazarus, 1991b), an increase in any of these
indicators of change portends greater future threats. Thus, at a

validity of this study, as appraisal processes are universal in character.

given time period, all three descriptors of crisis pattern should be
associated with anxiety (Sapolsky, 1999).

Hypothesis 1: The (a) average level, (b) velocity, and (c)
acceleration of the number of COVID-19 cases over the
preceding days are, on average, positively related to daily
anxiety.
It is important to note that appraisal is a dynamic phenomenon
(Eschleman et al., 2012), meaning that these characteristics might
not be equally salient at all points of the ongoing pandemic. As
mentioned above, arguments have been made both for an increase
in stressor impact over time, such that continued or cumulative
stressor exposure will eventually overwhelm the individual (Hobfoll, 1989; McEwen, 1998), as well as for a decrease in stressor
impact over time, such that individuals react less strongly to
experienced stressors (Brickman & Campbell, 1971; Frederick &
Loewenstein, 1999; Helson, 1948; Selye, 1956).
We posit that these two positions are less in opposition than they
seem. The key is stressor salience. That is, it is only continued
exposure to a salient stressor that threatens to overwhelm an
individual—if a stressor is not salient anymore, the associated
emotion is “made moot” (Lazarus, 1991a, p. 354). Stressors become less salient over time if their novelty fades, if they become
more predictable, and as they are seen as more of an established (as
opposed to emerging) environmental feature (Lazarus & Folkman,
1984; Selye, 1976; Watson, 2000).
This habituation is adaptive as it allows constant stimuli to fade
into the background, leaving resources available to deal with novel
circumstances or stimuli, which are most likely to require immediate attention (Frederick & Loewenstein, 1999) to protect the
organism (Herman, 2013; Miller et al., 2007). In this context,
average confirmed case levels represent the more static feature of
the crisis. Average cases are events that have already occurred
(with fewer anticipatory implications), are monotonic, and, overall, carry less salient information for the individual. Thus, their
presence becomes more familiar and predictable, requiring less
processing and attention (McGrath & Beehr, 1990). This allows
adjusting to “the new normal” over time (Brickman & Campbell,
1971). Thus, whereas we argued in the preceding text that
COVID-19 cases will be associated with anxiety in general, we
expect this effect to decrease over time as average case salience
weakens.
Hypothesis 2: Time moderates the positive effect of the average level of COVID-19 cases on daily anxiety such that the
effect of average cases decreases over time.
However, features of the stressor that indicate change are unlikely to become less salient over time. Changing conditions are
something that individual monitoring systems are very sensitive to
(Watson, 2000). In this context, the longer the crisis, the greater
the threat to one’s daily life, especially as the crisis drags on. The
positive velocity and acceleration of COVID-19 cases represent,
by definition, dynamic and novel circumstances that disallows
adaptation (Herman, 2013; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Instead,
this signals an increasing lack of predictability and uncertainty of
the stressor, which is likely to maintain stressor salience or even
loom ever larger on an individual’s view of their situation (Levine
& Wiener, 1989; Sapolsky, 1999). Put more simply, the “percep-

51

tion of events as improving or worsening” (Sapolsky, 1999, p. 459)
will be an issue that does not lose salience over time. Rather,
because such factors can relate to threat not only now, but also in
future instances (Lindsley et al., 1995; Riskind, 1997), their salience will remain stable or increase over time (Lazarus, 1991a). In
fact, continued exposure to stimuli can increase sensitization to
changes in severity or modality (Herman, 2013).
In addition, persistent positive rates of change over time indicate
that this crisis is not going to “blow over” (Kim et al., 2011),
further enhancing the salience of the stressor. In simpler terms,
whereas 1,000 COVID-19 cases may be less anxiety inducing in
April compared with in March, as individuals are accustomed to
average levels in the thousands, the degree to which these 1,000
cases represent increasing and exponential rates of growth is more
likely to overwhelm individuals’ emotional systems and capabilities to adapt (Hobfoll, 1989; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). These
arguments are also in line with allostatic load views (McEwen &
Seeman, 2003), which posit that continued exposure to a salient
stressor will have graver effects as time goes by; whereas level
becomes less salient, rate does not, allowing for individuals’
capacity to deal with the stressor to be overwhelmed. As a result,
we argue that the overall effects of positive velocity and acceleration have an accumulation affect, and thus their impact will
increase over time.
Hypothesis 3: Time moderates the positive effect of the (a)
velocity and (b) acceleration of COVID-19 cases on daily
anxiety, such that their effect increases over time.
Anxiety, on its own, is a particularly unpleasant aversive state.
However, what makes it even more insidious are the effects that it
has on individual cognition and attention, and thus, on individual
attitudes and behaviors. We examine general state anxiety’s effects
on engagement, performance, and emotional exhaustion at work.
First, anxiety creates a state of hypervigilance (Cheng & McCarthy, 2018; Ellis, 1962), which increases individual attention to
threats, as well as making such threats loom larger (Grupe &
Nitschke, 2013). The hypervigilance anxiety creates leaves little
room for other (especially more positive) states (Beal et al., 2005),
in essence pushing them out from the individual’s consciousness.
Second, the aversive character of anxiety-evoking experiences, as
well as the toll they take on attentional processes, can sap individual resources and interfere with recovery (Kagan, 1972; Sonnentag et al., 2017). These disengage the individual from the work
context, and prohibit resource mobilization toward the same, resulting in lower levels of work engagement. This is in line with
work arguing that persistent or unresolved stressor effects are
negatively linked with engagement (Sonnentag et al., 2010).
These disruptions also interfere with attention intensive processes, such as task performance (Eysenck et al., 2007); the focus
that performance requires is instead consumed by the hypervigilance and aversiveness associated with the anxious state (Beal et
al., 2005). Anxiety can lead to avoidance behaviors (Spector &
Fox, 2002) that, while not further impacting one’s affect, come at
the expense of performance (Johnson et al., 2010). Supporting
these points are meta-analytic estimates that show a negative
relationship between anxiety and job performance (Ford et al.,
2011). Anxious individuals also tend to ruminate more (Thau &
Mitchell, 2010) which, in addition to the above, further depletes

resources, leading to increased levels of emotional exhaustion
(Maslach et al., 2001). Several studies have demonstrated these
detrimental effects of anxiety on emotional exhaustion (e.g., McCarthy et al., 2016; Richardsen et al., 1992).
All in all, we propose that the pattern of COVID-19 features
will affect next-day functioning (i.e., engagement, job performance, and emotional exhaustion) via general state anxiety.
In line with the preceding temporal effects arguments, the
indirect effects of average cases on next-day functioning via
anxiety will decrease over time as the relationship between
number of cases and anxiety weakens. The indirect effects of
velocity and acceleration in cases, however, will increase over
time as the relationship between rate features and anxiety
strengthens.
Hypothesis 4: The indirect effects of COVID-19 case (a)
average levels, (b) velocity and (c) acceleration on next-day
engagement, performance and emotional exhaustion via anxiety will be moderated by time, such that the indirect effects of
average levels will weaken, but the indirect effects of velocity
and acceleration will strengthen over time.

Method
Sample and Procedure
Participants came from 35 states and the District of Columbia,
representing over 90% of the U.S. population and were recruited
using the Qualtrics panel service; such panels have been recently
validated as a data collection method (e.g., Eberly et al., 2017).
Participants were employed (30⫹ hr/week) in a wide range of
industries and jobs (see Appendix A). Data were collected in an
experience sampling methodology (ESM) study (Oklahoma State
University’s Institutional Review Board approved; Project: BU19 – 82; Title: A study on dynamic task motivation and engagement) composed of four partially overlapping waves (which we
term a shingled ESM). Demographics were collected at sign-up. In
the daily phase, participants were sent three surveys each workday
for three consecutive weeks, containing multiple daily measures of
anxiety and the dependent variables. Surveys were sent at workday
start (T1), middle (T2), and near the end (T3).
Across four waves, our final sample was 262 individuals
providing 2,332 day-level data points. A step-by-step procedure
of obtaining the final sample across waves is provided in
Appendix A; sample demographics are given in Table 1. We
conducted a series of one-way analyses of variance on nonfocal
variables (i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, job tenure, and weekly work
hours) and response times across waves to ensure that there
were no differences that could distort our findings; no statistically significant pairwise differences were found across
waves.

Measures
Unless otherwise noted, all our within-person variables were
measured at multiple points during the day and aggregated to the
day-level (see Appendix B for all survey-measured items, including anchors and referents). Variables relating to COVID-19 were

derived from data provided by Johns Hopkins University (https://
github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

Time
Time was represented by the log of collection day, ranging from
1 to 79, corresponding to our study period that spanned from
February 10, 2020 to April 28, 2020.

Average Levels of State Confirmed Cases
We included the average number of confirmed cases at state
level of the prior week (5-day period). We log transformed this
variable due to its skewed distribution.

Trajectory of State Confirmed Cases
For each study day, we ran a time series analysis to describe
linear (velocity) and curvilinear (acceleration) growth over the
preceding 5-day period. Estimates were then extracted to be used
as IVs. See the online supplemental material for a full description
of this process and example data.

Daily Anxiety
Anxiety was measured in each survey (T1, T2, and T3) and
reflected current states. A five-item measure was used (Marteau &
Bekker, 1992; Watson & Clark, 1994). Mean coefficient alpha
across 15 days was .94 (SD ⫽ .01).

Daily Dependent Variables
Engagement reflected current engagement with work tasks and
was assessed in T1 and T2 surveys (Bakker & Costa, 2014; mean
␣ ⫽ .91, SD ⫽ .02). Work task performance reflected performance
on T1 and T2 tasks and was assessed in T2 and T3 surveys
(Williams & Anderson, 1991; mean ␣ ⫽ .92, SD ⫽ .02). Emotional exhaustion reflected current states and was assessed in T1
and T3 surveys (Wharton, 1993; mean ␣ ⫽ .91, SD ⫽ .02).

Control Variables
Due to the potential of other attention-grabbing variables to
produce anxiety (Becker, 2005), we controlled for whether a
particular day was a record high in either confirmed cases or
deaths. Results were unchanged with or without these control
variables.

Analytic Strategy
Given the nested nature of the data (days within people), we
tested our hypotheses using multilevel path analysis in Mplus 8
(Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2017) with maximum likelihood estimation. Though the exogenous variables are all at Level 1, we used
raw scores instead of the more common group-centering as average level, velocity, and acceleration of COVID-19 cases are all
objective and meaningful indicators, instead of reflecting a person’s reported mean levels. Time (day) was centered at the date
that the first state (California) enacted stay-at-home orders (on
March 19, 2020, near the midpoint of data collection). This eases
interpretation of main effects and allows sufficient space to model
moderation (⫾25 days, starting when the United States first
reached 100 cases and ending with a point equidistantly past the
middle—these dates closely align to typical ⫾1 standard deviation

levels). Time was transformed via natural log as typical with long
time frames. We modeled time effects as random to accommodate
the moderation analyses (Snijders & Bosker, 2011). Indirect effects were tested via a 20,000 replication Monte Carlo parametric
bootstrap procedure (Preacher & Selig, 2012) to create 95% biascorrected confidence intervals (CIs).2
We also ran several supplementary analyses by (a) using
national instead of state-level confirmed cases; (b) using a
7-day instead of 5-day timeframe for COVID-19 patterns; (c)
including, as controls, relevant demographics, state-level
dummy codes or characteristics such as active stay-at-home
orders or economic issues and whether individuals were working from home; (d) raw time instead of the natural log of time;
and (e) a three-level model that accounted for nesting within
states.3 Results are all similar in size and scope (see the online
supplemental material for these as well as for analyses excluding the record day controls).

Results
In our shingled ESM design, daily responses were nested within
person. Within-person variables (Level 1) included the average
confirmed case level for the preceding five days in the person’s
state, the velocity and acceleration of change in COVID-19 cases,
daily anxiety, and next-day engagement, task performance, and
emotional exhaustion. Variance components analysis indicated
that all endogenous variables had a notable proportion of withinperson variance: 29.85% for anxiety, 29.44% for engagement,
54.94% for performance, and 28.90% for emotional exhaustion,
suggesting that the use of multilevel modeling is appropriate.
We conducted a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis to assess the fit of our measurement model (Byrne, 2001). Our proposed four-factor model demonstrated a good fit to the data,
␹2(71) ⫽ 284.71, p ⬍ .01; CFI ⫽ .99; RMSEA ⫽ .04; SRMR ⫽
.03. In addition, it performed better than alternative models in
which (a) emotional exhaustion and anxiety were collapsed, (b)
engagement and performance were collapsed, and (c) all items
were combined (see Table 2).
Table 1 shows means, standard deviations, and correlations.
Hypothesis 1, which predicted that the (a) average level, (b)
velocity, and (c) acceleration of the number of COVID-19 cases
over the past days are positively related to daily anxiety, was
supported (see Table 3), in that all these features of the crisis were
positively associated with anxiety at the study midpoint (March 19,
2020; ␥average level ⫽ .02, p ⫽ .04; ␥velocity ⫽ .32, p ⫽ .04;
␥acceleration ⫽ 1.34, p ⫽ .04).
Hypotheses 2 and 3 predicted that, over time, the effect of (a)
average level of COVID-19 cases on anxiety would decrease
(Hypothesis 2), but the effect of the (b) velocity and (c) acceleration of COVID-19 cases would increase (Hypothesis 3). The
interaction of average cases and time was negative (␥ ⫽ ⫺.07, p ⬍
.01), suggesting that, over time, the effect of average levels of
COVID-19 cases on anxiety did indeed decrease (slope ⫽ .06, p ⬍
.001 and slope ⫽ .00, p ⫽ .77 for early and late stages, respectively). In contrast, the interaction of time and velocity (␥ ⫽ .93,
p ⫽ .05) and acceleration (␥ ⫽ 4.16, p ⫽ .03) were positive,
suggesting that over time, the effects of velocity (slope ⫽ ⫺.21,
p ⫽ .23 and slope ⫽ .71, p ⫽ .03 for early and late stages,
respectively) and acceleration (slope ⫽ ⫺1.05, p ⫽ .10 and

slope ⫽ 3.06, p ⫽ .03 for early and late stages, respectively) on
anxiety increased (see Table 3). Hypotheses 2 and 3 were thus
supported.
Hypothesis 4 stated that time would moderate the indirect effects (IEs) of COVID-19 (a) level (negatively), (b) velocity, and
(c) acceleration (positively) on the dependent variable’s via anxiety. The IEs of case levels (see Table 4) on next-day engagement,
performance, and emotional exhaustion via anxiety were indeed
stronger in earlier (vs. later) stages (for early vs. middle:
⌬IEengagement ⫽ ⫺.0054, 95% CI [–.0101, ⫺.0022];
⌬IEperformance ⫽ ⫺.0042, 95% CI [–.0083, ⫺.0015]; ⌬IEemotional
exhaustion ⫽ .0100, 95% CI [.0053, .0158]; for middle vs. late:
⌬IEengagement ⫽ ⫺.0039, 95% CI [–.0074, ⫺.0016];
⌬IEperformance ⫽ ⫺.0031, 95% CI [–.0060, ⫺.0011]; ⌬IEemotional
exhaustion ⫽ .0073, 95% CI [.0039, .0115].
The IEs of COVID-19 velocity on next-day engagement, performance, and emotional exhaustion via anxiety were inversely
strengthened at later (vs. earlier) stages (for early vs. middle:
⌬IEengagement ⫽ .0774, 95% CI [.0088, .1955]; ⌬IEperformance ⫽
.0604, 95% CI [.0067, .1625]; ⌬IEemotional exhaustion ⫽ ⫺.1431,
95% CI [–.3097, ⫺.0078]; for middle vs. late: ⌬IEengagement ⫽
.0560, 95% CI [.0063, .1414]; ⌬IEperformance ⫽ .0438, 95% CI [.0048,
.1175]; ⌬IEemotional exhaustion ⫽ ⫺.1037, 95% CI [–.2239, ⫺.0056].
Likewise, the indirect effects of COVID-19 acceleration on engagement,
performance, and emotional exhaustion via anxiety were stronger at later
stages (for early vs. middle: ⌬IEengagement ⫽ .3476, 95% CI [.0622,
.8467]; ⌬IEperformance ⫽ .2714, 95% CI [.0446, .6994]; ⌬IEemotional
exhaustion ⫽ ⫺.6429, 95% CI [⫺1.3287, ⫺.0873]; for middle vs. late:
⌬IEengagement ⫽ .2514, 95% CI [.0450, .6124]; ⌬IEperformance ⫽ .1963,
95% CI [.0323, .5057]; ⌬IEemotional exhaustion ⫽ ⫺.4649, 95% CI
[–.9608, ⫺.0632]. Overall, IEs were significant for early and middle (but
not for late) stages for average cases; they were significant for middle and
late stages (but not for early) for velocity and acceleration. These results
are thus supportive of our hypotheses.

Discussion
We investigated anxiety associated with the current COVID-19
pandemic, a context characterized by an uncertain and changing
threat over time. Grounded in appraisal theories, we focused on the
experience of the stressor as it unfolded over time. We proposed
and found that, within a given time frame, the overall level of a
crisis (current average COVID-19 cases) and the rate of change
(velocity and acceleration of case growth) have independent effects on individual experiences of general state anxiety, which in
turn relates to next-day functioning. Moreover, we showed that
these effects change over time; the impact of average levels on
state anxiety lessened, but the impact of both rate variables increased as the crisis continued to unfold.

State accounted for a trivial percentage (i.e., less than .20%) of the
variance for endogenous variables (all daily: anxiety ⫽ .20%, engagement ⫽ .09%, performance ⫽ .19%, emotional exhaustion ⫽ .11%),
making it unlikely that shared state-level experiences might create analytical issues not addressed in our two-level model (see online supplemental
material).

theory, but also provides an analytical roadmap for testing the
updated predictions from theoretical perspectives that integrate
changes over time.
Our study also has implications for practice, both within and
outside of the COVID-19 context. Our findings imply that people
are likely to acclimate to anxiety over time if stressors are constant
(e.g., level of crime for police officers, number of patients for
medical staff), yet changes in the rate (velocity or acceleration)
that indicate the situation is worsening will still have an impact.
This can guide decision makers to consider the trajectory of a
stressor unfolding over time, as interventions may be more effective if they focus on changing, rather than static, stressors. This
also argues against allowing situations to continually deteriorate
(as such deterioration would be anxiety generating). Likewise, our
study can guide practitioners in allocating resources to individuals
who might be personally experiencing anxiety due to ongoing
stressors—people do not “get used to” contexts involving problematic rates, especially over time.

Implications
Our findings have important implications for appraisal theories
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and related frameworks (Edwards,
1992). First, we show that contexts should be evaluated holistically. Ongoing stressors unfold over time in nuanced ways, all of
which are important in predicting anxiety. Thus, a bad situation
that is steadily worsening differs from one that is improving and
different from one where the deterioration is itself accelerating.
Considering differing appraisals of ongoing stressors over time
adds nuance and predictive ability to the temporal aspect of the
theory (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Integration of concepts from
cybernetic views allows for more complex and interesting effects
to be tested in the future.
We showed that the impact of the various aspects of the stressor
change over time. The more static aspects diminish in magnitude,
whereas the dynamic aspects increase. This temporal perspective
may be the first step in resolving seemingly contradictory theoretical perspectives related to adaptation (i.e., the effects of ongoing
stressors decreasing over time [Brickman & Campbell, 1971;
Frone & McFarlin, 1989; Helson, 1948]) versus accumulation
effects (i.e., ongoing stressors becoming overwhelming over time
[Lazarus, 1999; McEwen & Seeman, 2003]). Whereas these views
might appear to have opposite predictions, we find that they can,
in fact, operate in tandem, based on how different facets of a
context are evaluated over time. This work not only enhances

Limitations
Our study is not without limitations. First, we only used selfreported measures of anxiety and next-day functioning. Whereas
no reasonable alternative exists for some of these variables (anxiety and engagement), if the behavioral variables were measured
via more objective reports our concerns about common method

variance would be lessened. However, we separated the variables
over time and used multiple measurements for each variable
(which renders them more reliable), somewhat assuaging these
concerns; in addition, the results are, broadly speaking, in line with
other investigations of the effects of anxiety on such measures of
functioning.
Another limitation is that we did not account for some important
factors that may be impacting people’s daily life during this crisis;
of note are home factors such as work-family conflict and family
demands. Part of the unfolding nature of COVID-19 has been a
record shift to working from home. While the enactment of stayat-home orders resulted in only around 50% of our sample shifting
to working from home (at the highest point), and our model was
robust to controlling for such shifts, inability to control for such
variables directly is a limitation. Another limitation is that the
composition of our sample is not nationally representative in
gender or race.
Our operationalization of COVID-19 variables also requires that
individuals are, to some extent, aware of the broad shapes of this
crisis. Absent this, it would be difficult to explain our results. We
do, however, see this assumption as reasonable; people follow
crises closely (as noted above), and knowledge of this crisis was
widespread early. Further, the COVID-19 crisis persisted past the
end of data collection in April, generating periods of slowing
(negative velocity/deceleration) not seen prior, in addition to the
growth and plateauing (null velocity/acceleration) previously observed. Whereas growth and plateauing are contexts that we were
able to link to reduced anxiety, our data did not include major
periods of deceleration, limiting our ability to draw conclusions
about anxiety when bad situations improve, as opposed to worsen
or persist. Last, although our work contributes to the transactional

theory of stress, this contribution, at least for the time being, relates
only to adverse situations, as we cannot automatically extend these
findings to positive situations over time. This is, however, an
opportunity for future work to investigate unfolding positive contexts (such as changes in compensation) over time.

Conclusion
The trajectories of unfolding crises can be characterized in a
variety of ways. Using the transactional theory of stress, we
illustrate the importance of looking at these holistically. We demonstrated that the impact of these various trajectory aspects can
strengthen or diminish effects on work outcomes via anxiety over
time. Future work can provide a contribution by integrating these
insights into many investigations on the effects of persistent adverse situations.

Sample and Procedure
This study was conducted in four partially overlapping waves.
For each wave, participants were asked to complete three surveys
a day for three consecutive weeks. Surveys were sent at the start
(T1), middle (T2), and near the end (T3) of the workday; average
completion times were 9:30 a.m., 1:12 p.m., and 5:26 p.m., respectively.
The first wave started on February 6, 2020, and 205 participants
completed the sign-up survey. The daily phase started on February
10, 2020. On the fourth day of the study, we stopped the participation of 45 people because they (a) missed attention checks
embedded in the survey for 3 days in a row or (b) carelessly
responded to some qualitative questions (included as part of a
broader data collection). In addition, a few participants had responded to the survey more than once. After removing these
duplicated daily surveys, our initial Wave 1 sample was 934
day-level observations from 130 participants. Of these day-level
observations, 27 were excluded because they were completed
outside the required timeframe and 376 were excluded because
they missed responses in one of the three daily surveys on a study
day. We were left with 75 individuals providing 531 day-level
observations for the first wave.
Similarly, our second wave started on February 19, 2020 with
225 individuals in the initial survey with the daily phase starting on
February 24, 2020. Of these individuals, 53 were removed for the
same reasons as above (i.e., attention checks and careless responses). Excluding missed responses within a particular study day
and incorrectly timed responses left us with 92 individuals providing 731 day-level observations for the second wave.
The third wave started on March 5, 2020 with 90 individuals,
and the daily phase starting on March 9, 2020. This was reduced
to 73 individuals (after exclusions) providing 410 day-level

observations. Missing response and incorrectly timed responses
brought the sample to 39 individuals providing 244 day-level
observations.
The fourth wave started on April 4, 2020 and included 224
individuals who completed the initial survey; the daily phase
started on April 8, 2020. The sample was reduced to 180 individuals providing 1,618 observations after exclusions (duplicated
surveys). Of this sample, 60 observations were excluded because
they were not completed within the required timeframe. Accounting for missing daily surveys left us with a sample of 113 individuals with 962 day-level observations.
Our initial combined sample across four waves therefore was
composed of 319 individuals providing 2,468 day-level observations. After removing 48 individuals with a single daily observation (our design required participants with at least two consecutive
days without missing data), we had 271 individuals providing
2,420 daily observations.
Missing item-level data (21 observations) on our dependent
variables (i.e., engagement, performance, and emotional exhaustion) reduced the total sample to 2,399 observations from
271 individuals. In addition, we were not able to definitively
determine the locations of eight individuals (who had provided
65 observations) from this subset, leaving us with 2,334 observations from 263 individuals. Two other observations (belonging to one individual) were not usable due to being from a state
that had no other observations. Therefore, our final sample for
analysis includes 2,332 observations within 262 individuals.
These individuals were all full-time employees (working 42.5
hr per week on average) in a varied set of industries and jobs.
