During normal and predictable circumstances, employees’ occupational calling (i.e., a transcendent
passion to use their talent and competencies toward positive societal impact and a sense of meaningfulness derived from working in a chosen occupational domain) is observed to be relatively stable.
However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, circumstances have become anything but normal
and predictable, thus putting employees’ sense of occupational calling to the test. In this study, we
investigate the possibility that occupational calling fluctuates across days during situations of crisis, and
we identify antecedents and consequence of such fluctuations. To test our model, we conducted a daily
diary study of 66 nurses working in intensive care units over 5 consecutive work days in a specialized
Wuhan hospital that only admitted confirmed COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in
China. We found that the daily number of code blue events (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts
with the primary goal of patient revival) was positively related to daily occupational calling for nurses.
Moreover, individual differences in prosocial motivation predicted the average level and variability of
occupational calling over the 5 days, which subsequently related to the nurses’ job performance. Our
study sheds light on how occupational calling enables people with the needed occupational knowledge
and skills to function effectively in crisis situations.

environment where they have been racing against the clock to save
lives despite the personal risk of hospital-acquired (i.e., nosocomial) infection. To enable nurses to prevail in their battle against
COVID-19, occupational calling—a transcendent passion to use
one’s talent and competencies toward positive societal impact and
a sense of meaningfulness derived from working in a chosen
occupational domain (Dik & Shimizu, 2019)—is a critical psychological driving force that keeps nurses focused and motivated
despite the tremendous challenges.
To date, occupational calling has been empirically examined as
a relatively stable construct that evolves slowly over long periods
of time (e.g., across one’s career or life span; Dobrow, 2013;
Dobrow & Heller, 2015). Yet qualitative studies hint at the possibility that occupational calling may also fluctuate during shorter
periods of time, especially during situations of crisis (Singh, 2008;
Wrzesniewski, 2002). In particular, salient societal needs during
crises may incite a sense of occupational calling for people whose
professional competencies are crucial for meeting those needs
(Kent, 2019; Singh, 2008). The COVID-19 pandemic is an exemplar of such an unusual crisis situation (Rudolph & Zacher, 2020),
which provides a unique opportunity to empirically examine fluctuations in employees’ occupational calling during short periods of
time. When caring and treating COVID-19 patients in critical
conditions, nurses must devote themselves to the work and apply

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health crisis. To
battle this crisis, intensive and critical care is an integral component (Murthy et al., 2020). In intensive care units (ICUs), nurses
play a critical role by providing around-the-clock monitoring and
treatment of critically ill patients (Lakanmaa et al., 2015). Nurses
working in ICUs in the epicenter are in an unusual and extreme

CRITICAL ACTIVITIES AND DAILY OCCUPATIONAL CALLING

their professional knowledge and skills at their highest level to, for
example, vigilantly monitor and record vital signs, critically assess
patient conditions and the evolution of the disease process, and
immediately respond to emergency situations based on sound
judgment and critical thinking. Yet despite undertaking these challenging activities, feedback that their occupational skills are highly
valued and meaningful for treating COVID-19 patients is also
more visible and salient (Barnes & Barnes, 2020). Undertaking
these challenging yet meaningful activities is likely to impact
nurses’ occupational calling (Dik & Shimizu, 2019; Singh, 2008).
In this research, we examined whether the occupational calling
of nurses working in COVID-19 ICUs fluctuates over time during
the pandemic. Although it has been suggested that occupational
calling may ebb and flow, especially during crises (Wrzesniewski,
2002), this possibility has not been empirically verified. We also
examined why such fluctuations may occur. It has been proposed
that engaging in challenging yet meaningful activities bolsters
occupational calling during crises (Dik & Shimizu, 2019; Singh,
2008), which, for ICU nurses, are epitomized by “code blue”
events (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts with the primary
goal of patient revival; Vindigni et al., 2017). Such events are
“characteristically unpredictable” and result in life/death differences (Rousek & Hallbeck, 2011, p. 197). During code blue
events, the initiation, execution, and termination of resuscitation
require nurses’ rapid assessment and treatment (Craig et al., 2020)
and application of their full concentration and professional skills.
We thus suspected that participating in code blue events reinforces
nurses’ occupational calling.
Although our primary focus was on within-person fluctuations
in occupational calling, we nevertheless incorporated extant research on between-person differences in occupational calling (e.g.,
Duffy et al., 2011; Gazica & Spector, 2015; Wrzesniewski et al.,
1997). Merging these two perspectives led us to consider differences in the variability of nurses’ occupational calling over time
(i.e., different fluctuation patterns) in addition to differences in
average level. Given that making a positive and meaningful societal impact is central to occupational calling (Dik & Shimizu,
2019; Thompson & Bunderson, 2019), we examined nurses’ traitlike desire to benefit others—that is, their prosocial motivation—as a key antecedent of between-person differences in occupational calling variability and average level. Prosocial motivation
is also relevant based on our COVID-19 ICU context as emergency health care contexts such as this require individuals who are
driven to help others in need (Bolino & Grant, 2016) and who
derive a sense of meaningfulness when that drive to help is
fulfilled (Thompson & Bunderson, 2019).
Finally, in addition to examining patterns and antecedents of
occupational calling fluctuations, we also examined the consequences of these fluctuations for nurses’ overall job performance
in the COVID-19 ICU. Recent research has emphasized that both
variability and average level of psychological states are important
in predicting performance outcomes at work (e.g., Beal et al.,
2013; Gielnik et al., 2020). Consistent with previous findings, we
expected that a high average level of occupational calling leads to
increased effort for nurses to deploy their knowledge and skills,
thus facilitating job performance in COVID-19 care. Building on
this, we developed original predictions about how and why high
variability in occupational calling is likely negatively associated
with persistence and steady effort, which undermines COVID-19

care as well. Our hypothesized model is presented in Figure 1. To
test this model, we conducted a daily study of nurses working in
COVID-19 ICUs in Wuhan during the peak of the pandemic in
China.
By investigating within-person daily fluctuations and betweenperson patterns of fluctuations in occupational calling during the
COVID-19 pandemic, we contribute to the literature in several
ways. First, we contribute to the calling literature by empirically
verifying the occurrence of calling fluctuations during short time
periods and showing that extreme work experiences during a crisis
situation can bolster daily occupational calling. Second, by examining prosocial motivation’s effect on fluctuation patterns of occupational calling, we provide a more nuanced understanding of
the role played by individual differences with respect to occupational calling (Fleeson et al., 2002). We do so by demonstrating
how individual differences can impact the variability of occupational calling, in addition to oft-studied average level of occupational calling. We also answer the call by Thompson and Bunderson (2019) to shed greater light on the antecedents of occupational
calling. Finally, by demonstrating the unique effects of variability
and average level of occupational calling on COVID-19 care, we
broaden attention from the static effects of calling to more dynamic effects that unfold over time. Doing so opens new avenues
for calling research by considering longitudinal effects of emergent patterns of calling.

Hypothesis Development
Daily Number of COVID-19 Code Blue Events and
Daily Occupational Calling for Nurses
Previous research has demonstrated that calling is conducive to
various desirable work outcomes, such as job satisfaction (Wrzesniewski et al., 1997), organizational commitment (Duffy et al.,
2011), employee retention (Chen et al., 2018), and in-role performance (Kim et al., 2018). However, our knowledge of its antecedents is limited as very few studies have identified what helps
and hinders calling (Duffy, Allan, et al., 2014; Duffy, Douglass, et
al., 2014). One reason for this limited attention is that calling is
typically viewed as a stable, trait-like construct (Duffy, Allan, et
al., 2014). As such, calling is believed to be fixed and not responsive to external stimuli. Yet some empirical evidence suggests that
calling can in fact change markedly over long periods of time
(Dobrow, 2013; Dobrow & Heller, 2015). For example, in a

ZHU ET AL.

7-year, four-wave longitudinal study of developing musicians,
Dobrow (2013) found that people experienced different levels of
initial calling and also showed different change patterns in calling.
To date, the few studies that empirically examined change only
considered changes in calling over extended (e.g., yearly) periods
of time, which springs from the notion that calling is relatively
stable and changes slowly over time (if at all). However, findings
from qualitative studies question this limited view of calling
change and instead suggest that calling may fluctuate during
shorter (e.g., daily) periods in extreme contexts. For example, a
qualitative study at a New York City hospital near Ground Zero
found that the escalating demands due to the September 11 attacks
made health care workers more aware of their occupational duty
and meaningfulness (Singh, 2008). The attacks helped them realize
that their duty “is to treat patients and they come first” (p. 224).
Likewise, research focusing on nursing experiences at Ground
Zero hinted at calling experiences immediately after the tragedy.
For example, a nurse recalled that
In the moments that followed [the attacks], I felt a pull in my heart. A
message from deep inside came through loud and clear: “You must
help. There is a great need and a purpose to be served. You must go
there.” (Gatto, 2002, p. 5)

When facing the urgency to help, nurses also felt fortunate to be
“in a profession that could provide tangible assistance to those in
need” and that they “possessed the skills that enabled them to
respond” (Dickerson et al., 2002, pp. 31–32).
The current COVID-19 pandemic has created a parallel crisis
situation that impacts those in the front line (Truxillo et al., 2020),
specifically a public health emergency in which ICU capacity is
strained and nurses’ professional services are greatly needed. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19 developed severe
conditions that required intensive care (Murthy et al., 2020). The
conditions of COVID-19 patients in ICUs usually deteriorate
quickly, causing respiratory and cardiac failure. They require
nurses who are skilled in operating critical care devices and
familiar with emergency procedures (Qiu et al., 2020). Also,
dozens of medications and treatments need to be coordinated for a
single patient, and emergency situations can pop up unpredictably
(Carenzo et al., 2020; J. Xie et al., 2020). As such, ICU nurses
need to fully utilize their occupational skills and work intensively
to ensure effective care of patients. Undertaking challenging yet
meaningful activities like these in extreme work situations is
believed to bolster individuals’ occupational calling (Dik & Shimizu, 2019).
For nurses in COVID-19 ICUs, the number of code blue events
provides a daily reminder of the necessity for nurses’ skill set and
the criticality and impact of their work, which is expected to
bolster nurses’ occupational calling on a daily basis. First, a higher
than average daily number of code blue events experienced by
nurses signals a more salient and urgent need, which can lead to
stronger feelings of duty, obligation, and responsibility to do one’s
work for achieving significant societal impact (Dik & Shimizu,
2019). During a code blue event, interventions must be carried out
immediately. Even a few minutes of delay in handling the situation
may yield devastating consequences (Hassager et al., 2020). In
fact, a study on COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China showed that
most resuscitation (89%) was initiated within 1 min (Shao et al.,

2020). By rising up to the occasion and meeting such unusual
demands, nurses in a COVID-19 ICU are able to clearly experience their work’s importance in saving lives and, as a result,
develop a strong sense of purpose in performing their work duties
on that day. We therefore expected that the more code blue events
a nurse handles in one day, compared to their own average experience, the stronger the feeling of calling they will experience.
Second, a higher daily number of COVID-19 ICU code blue
events experienced by nurses, compared to their average experience, also offers more opportunities for nurses to fully utilize their
occupational knowledge and skills. People derive a sense of selfrealization from utilizing their knowledge and skills to address the
intensive needs from work due to a perceived match between one’s
competencies and the job requirements, which deepens people’s
personal connection to their occupation (Thompson & Bunderson,
2019). The standard practices and protocols for dealing with the
emergency situations of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are
still under development, and patients’ responses to a particular
treatment are uncertain and require critical assessments and close
monitoring (Carenzo et al., 2020; J. Xie et al., 2020). Therefore,
nurses dealing with COVID-19 patients in ICUs need to be highly
focused and fully mobilize their knowledge and skills to provide
individualized clinical care and make constant adjustments. Accordingly, a higher daily number of code blue events experienced
by nurses, compared to their own average experience, may enhance nurses’ personal connection to their work and thus incite
higher levels of daily occupational calling. Therefore, we hypothesize that on days that nurses experience a higher daily number of
COVID-19 ICU code blue events, they will experience higher
levels of daily occupational calling (Hypothesis 1).

Prosocial Motivation and Average Level and
Variability of Occupational Calling
While occupational calling can fluctuate in short (daily) time
periods as a result of extreme work experiences, fluctuation patterns may differ across nurses. We propose that individual differences in the experienced level and variability of occupational
calling can be accounted for by prosocial motivation, a stable
individual difference in prosocial values and other orientation
(Bolino & Grant, 2016). We expected that high prosocial motivation is associated with a high average level of occupational calling.
People high in prosocial motivation have an innate desire to
benefit others (Ryan & Connell, 1989) and are sensitive to others’
needs in order to provide appropriate and effective help (Grant &
Berry, 2011). Nurses with high prosocial motivation are more
likely to be aware of patients’ needs and have a feeling of moral
duty to respond to these needs by using their professional knowledge and skills. Moreover, nurses with high prosocial motivation
are more attracted to health care work because of their prosocial
value. As such, nurses high in prosocial motivation are more likely
to experience the meaningfulness of ICU nurse work over time,
leading to a high average level of occupational calling. We thus
predict that prosocial motivation is positively related to average
level of occupational calling of COVID-19 ICU nurses (Hypothesis 2).
Prosocial motivation can also influence how variable individuals’ daily occupational calling is over time. We argue that people
high in prosocial motivation, compared to those low in prosocial

CRITICAL ACTIVITIES AND DAILY OCCUPATIONAL CALLING

motivation, are less variable in the extent to which they experience
occupational calling. According to Mischel and Shoda (1995,
1998), the underlying personality system for a given person affects
the variability of information processing and, in turn, the variability of responses across situations. People high in prosocial motivation seek to benefit others and maintain a prosocial identity
(Bolino & Grant, 2016). To achieve this goal, they are likely to
regulate their attention toward others’ needs and self-initiate helping even when external needs are not explicit (Keltner et al., 2014;
Knafo et al., 2011). In other words, people high in prosocial
motivation are less likely to lower their desire to benefit others in
response to new or changing situational cues than those low in
prosocial motivation. Based on this logic, we expected that nurses
high in prosocial motivation are sensitive to the needs of patients,
colleagues, and society, and remain ready to help them, and thus
consistently experience a strong sense of duty and obligation to
their occupation. Their occupational calling should show less
variability over time. Thus, we hypothesize that prosocial motivation is negatively related to the occupational calling variability of
COVID-19 ICU nurses (Hypothesis 3).

Relations of Average Level and Variability of
Occupational Calling With Job Performance
A high average level of occupational calling over time should
contribute to a high level of job performance of COVID-19 ICU
nurses. The transcendent nature of the destiny and duty embedded
in occupational calling propels people to deploy their talents,
competencies, and efforts for the benefits of others (Bunderson &
Thompson, 2009). This is crucial for nurses’ job performance as
critically ill patients need intensive care that is closely relevant to
nurses’ professional knowledge, skills, and efforts. With a strong
occupational calling, nurses are motivated to exert their effort and
fully utilize their competencies to treat patients. Moreover, the
feeling of meaningfulness involved in occupational calling creates
a psychological condition for people to focus on their own experience and overlook the external obstacles in pursuing their callings (Dobrow & Heller, 2015). As a result, people are likely to
increase their efforts and exhibit perseverance in the face of
obstacles. ICU nurses are likely to encounter numerous setbacks
and obstacles in treating critically ill patients as there is a great
deal of uncertainty in handling severe cases of COVID-19 (Alhazzani et al., 2020; Grote & Pfrombeck, 2020). Occupational calling
enables them to remain focused and overcome these difficulties,
thereby yielding higher job performance. We predict that average
level of occupational calling is positively related to the job performance of COVID-19 ICU nurses (Hypothesis 4).
Hypotheses 2 and 4 together suggest a mediating relationship in
which prosocial motivation is positively related to job performance
through its conducive effect on average level of occupational
calling over time. We propose the following mediation hypothesis:
Average level of occupational calling mediates the positive relationship of prosocial motivation with the job performance of
COVID-19 ICU nurses (Hypothesis 5).
Moving beyond the focus on static calling in the extant
literature, we expected that occupational calling variability has
an incremental, negative relationship with the job performance
of COVID-19 ICU nurses. Occupational calling variability implies that individuals are heavily invested in their work on some

7

days but withdrawn from work on other days. This variability
results in a loss of persistence and task focus, harming overall
job performance. Persistence and consistency of effort are particularly important to COVID-19 ICU tasks as ICU patients
require constant intensive care. Specifically, nurses need to
provide vigilant monitoring to those critically ill patients, who
are “physiologically unstable, requiring constant and minuteto-minute titration of therapy according to the evolution of the
disease process” (Brilli et al., 2001, p. 2010). They also need to
recognize any signs of clinical changes in patients’ conditions
to prevent deterioration, especially due to the rapid progression
of COVID-19 (Brilli et al., 2001). Thus, having sizable fluctuations in one’s calling may hinder the delivery of effective
treatment in COVID-19 ICUs.
Moreover, variability in occupational calling may also negatively impact supervisor perceptions of one’s performance.
Supervisors tend to put more weight on negative information
than on positive and neutral information when conducting performance appraisals (Ganzach, 1995), meaning that supervisors
are likely to rate the overall performance based on the lower
bound of one’s effort rather than the average or higher bound of
one’s effort. As such, for two nurses with the same average
level of occupational calling, the nurse with more fluctuation in
occupational calling will likely receive a lower level of performance rating. To illustrate this point, we draw a numerical
example similar to Matta et al. (2017). Consider two nurses who
rated their occupational calling on a 7-point scale every day for
a period of time. Nurse 1 rated a “4” every day, whereas Nurse
2 rated a “1” on half of the days and a “7” on the remaining half
of the days. Although both reached an average rating of “4,” the
experiences of occupational calling of these two nurses were
different, and the effects on performance ratings should also be
different. Supervisors are expected to attend more to the days
when Nurse 2 experienced low occupational calling and thus
rate Nurse 2 lower on overall performance during this work
period. Moreover, when employees’ work behaviors show high
variability, overall performance tends to be rated lower because
supervisors likely attribute it to external factors rather than
personal factors like effort or skill (Johnson et al., 2012). Thus,
we propose the following hypothesis: Occupational calling variability is negatively related to the job performance of
COVID-19 ICU nurses, incremental to level of occupational
calling (Hypothesis 6).
Hypotheses 3 and 6 together imply a mediating relationship in
which prosocial motivation is negatively related to occupational
calling variability that in turn is negatively related to job performance. We propose that occupational calling variability mediates
the positive relationship of prosocial motivation with the job
performance of COVID-19 ICU nurses (Hypothesis 7).

Method
Sample and Procedure
Using an experience sampling design, we collected data from
nurses of a Joint Commission International accredited general
hospital in eastern China who worked in a large COVID-19 ICU in
Wuhan during the peak of outbreak in China (i.e., in February and
March 2020). This study was approved by the Sub-Committee on

ZHU ET AL.

Research Ethics and Safety of the University Research Committee,
Lingnan University, Hong Kong (Title of Study: “Antecedents and
Consequences of Occupational Calling During Crisis,” Protocol
Number: EC073/1920). A total of 72 nurses, led by two head
nurses, from this general hospital were assigned to work in the ICU
of a Wuhan specialized hospital for a work week (i.e., 5 consecutive work days). The ICU of this specialized hospital only admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were
classified as “critical” (respiratory failure, shock, and multiple
organ dysfunction or failure; WHO-China Joint Mission, 2020).
With the assistance of the administration office of the general
hospital and following approval of a university research ethics and
safety committee, we distributed an online study announcement to
both the 72 nurses and the two head nurses, along with a letter
seeking their consent of participation. In the announcement, we
informed the nurses that participation was voluntary and that all
responses would be kept confidential and only used for third-party
research purposes. Sixty-six nurses (response rate: 91.67%) and both
head nurses (response rate: 100%) accepted our invitation and participated in our surveys. Among them, all were women, and 69.70% had
working experience in ICUs before the current assignment. They had
an average age of 31.80 years (SD ⫽ 4.79) and an average nurse
tenure of 9.03 years (SD ⫽ 5.42).
Data collection was administered in two phases. First, all 66
participating nurses completed an online questionnaire on demographics and prosocial motivation before beginning their assignment at the Wuhan specialized hospital. Then, they completed a
5-min daily online survey for 5 consecutive work days for the
assigned work week after their ICU shift ended every day. Their
daily shift typically lasted 6 hr. During the daily diary survey
phase, we received a total of 203 daily surveys out of a possible
330 daily surveys (66 participants ⫻ 5 days), resulting in a
compliance rate of 61.52%. At the end of the work week, the two
head nurses rated the job performance of each of the 66 nurses
based on their performance during that week.

Measures
We translated the measures from English to Chinese following
Brislin’s (1986) translation/back-translation procedure.1 All measures are reported in Appendix A. Participants responded to all
items on a 7-point scale (from 1 ⫽ strongly disagree to 7 ⫽
strongly agree).

Daily Number of COVID-19 Code Blue Events
Nurses reported the number of code blue events that they
encountered during each daily shift. The number per shift ranged
from zero to three.

Occupational Calling
To measure occupational calling, we included the two items
assessing the general presence of a calling from the Brief Calling
Scale (Dik et al., 2012) and one item that assesses calling specifically in a medical context (Curlin et al., 2007). The Cronbach’s
alpha was .90. We operationalized average level of occupational
calling using each nurse participant’s mean level of daily occupational calling over the 5-day period. To operationalize occupational calling variability, we used standard deviation in daily
occupational calling over the 5-day period following the sugges-

tion of Roberson and colleagues (2007), who recommended standard deviation as a dispersion measure in multilevel research. This
practice has been adopted in previous studies (e.g., Matta et al.,
2017; Scott et al., 2012).

Prosocial Motivation
Prosocial motivation was measured using the four-item scale
developed by Grant (2008). The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale
was .93.

Job Performance
To ensure the reliability of job performance ratings, the two
head nurses rated the job performance of each participant. This
Joint Commission International accredited general hospital had
an established performance appraisal system that rated nurse
job performance based on criteria such as clinical competence
(e.g., giving medication and treatments, operating specialized
equipment, and evaluating and responding immediately to
emergency situations), professional competence (e.g., communication, time management and prioritization, and critical thinking), and nursing errors (e.g., problems revolving around infections, medication errors, and equipment injuries). Nurse
participants’ performance during the 5-day study period was
evaluated using the hospital’s performance appraisal system
(which ranged from 0 to 100). The two head nurses were
knowledgeable about performance because they worked closely
with each nurse during the study period. The correlation of the
ratings from the two head nurses was .73, indicating high
agreement between them. We averaged the two ratings to form
an overall job performance score.

Control Variables
To account for a time effect, we controlled for study day. In
addition, we controlled for prior ICU work experience (1 ⫽ prior
ICU work experience, 0 ⫽ no prior ICU work experience). ICU
work experience may relate to job performance in this context due
to greater familiarity with ICU equipment and procedures (Lakanmaa et al., 2015). Last, previous research has shown that depletion
is negatively associated with calling (Jager et al., 2017), and
depletion may result from code blue events. Therefore, we controlled for depletion at the daily level to rule out the possibility that
any association between code blue events and calling owes to a
depletion-based mechanism. Daily depletion was measured by
adapting three items from Lanaj et al. (2014). The Cronbach’s
alpha for this scale was .82.

Results
We first performed a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis to
demonstrate construct distinctiveness. Results showed that the

First, two bilinguals translated the measures from English to Chinese
independently. Most word choices and expressions were agreed upon
between the two translators. Minor disagreements were resolved based on
discussion. Then, a third bilingual translated the Chinese version back to
English. The three bilinguals discussed and made modifications to resolve
any minor discrepancies. The translated version was sent to the administration office of the general hospital, which suggested that our items
applied to their working context.

in Table 1. We tested our hypotheses with multilevel modeling
using Mplus 8 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998 –2017) because our data
had a two-level structure (i.e., within and between person). At
Level 1, we specified the fixed effects of control variables and
daily number of code blue events on daily occupational calling. At
Level 2, we specified the effects of the control variable (i.e., ICU
work experience) and prosocial motivation on average level of
occupational calling, occupational calling variability, and job performance. We also specified the effects of average level of occupational calling and occupational calling variability on job performance. To facilitate the interpretation of findings, we person-mean
centered the Level-1 daily number of code blue events and daily
depletion and grand-mean centered the Level-2 ICU work experience and prosocial motivation (Hofmann & Gavin, 1998). In
particular, for testing the within-person relationship (Hypothesis
1), our focus was on predicting nurses’ within-person fluctuations
in occupational calling. Thus, person-mean centering was used for
daily number of code blue events. Study day, as a control variable
representing the day of the study ranging from 1 to 5, was uncentered (Lanaj et al., 2016). Unstandardized coefficient estimates of
the hypothesized model are presented in Table 2. Syntax and
output of Tables 1 and 2 are reported in the online supplemental
materials.
Results showed that daily number of code blue events was
positively related to daily occupational calling (␥ ⫽ .33, p ⫽ .002),
which supported Hypothesis 1. Moreover, all hypothesized
between-person relations were statistically significant (i.e., Hypotheses 2–7). Specifically, prosocial motivation was positively
related to average level of occupational calling (␥ ⫽ .77, p ⬍ .001)
and negatively related to occupational calling variability
(␥ ⫽ ⫺.20, p ⫽ .042). Thus, Hypotheses 2 and 3 were supported.
In support of Hypotheses 4 and 6, average level of occupational
calling was positively related to job performance (␥ ⫽ 3.10, p ⫽
.007), and occupational calling variability was negatively related
to job performance (␥ ⫽ ⫺2.58, p ⫽ .004). Hypotheses 5 and 7
predicted the mediating roles of average level of occupational
calling and occupational calling variability in linking prosocial
motivation to job performance. We used the Monte Carlo method
to derive the 95% confidence interval of indirect effects. In support
of Hypotheses 5 and 7, we observed positive indirect effects of
prosocial motivation on job performance via average level of
occupational calling (indirect effect ⫽ 2.38, 95% CI [0.66, 4.16])

and via occupational calling variability (indirect effect ⫽ .51,
[0.02, 1.02]).2

Discussion
Theoretical and Practical Implications
Our study demonstrates that occupational calling fluctuates
on a daily basis during the COVID-19 crisis for ICU nurses.
Our short-term, dynamic view opens up new theoretical avenues for exploring antecedents that lead to short-term highs and
lows in occupational calling. Specifically, we examined daily
number of COVID-19 code blue events as a situational trigger
of daily occupational calling that accounted for its short-term
fluctuations. This finding provides empirical support for the
proposal that crisis situations can incite the spontaneous motivational responses of people who are trained to help the vulnerable and whose occupational knowledge and skills are essential for dealing with the crisis (Singh, 2008; Wrzesniewski,
2002). While showing that crisis situations signaling urgent
external needs can incite occupational calling of nurses, we
speculate that this effect extends to other occupations with
challenging yet meaningful activities (e.g., firefighters combatting wildfires, rescue workers during an earthquake or hurricane), which can be explored in future investigations.
In addition to investigating daily fluctuations in occupational
calling, we considered the composition of these fluctuations in
terms of average level and variability over time. Our results
showed that nurses differed in both average level and variability
of occupational calling and that such differences are explained
by prosocial motivation. Nurses higher (vs. lower) in prosocial
motivation experienced not only a higher average level of
occupational calling but also a less variable level of occupational calling. This finding empirically demonstrates that prosocial motivation serves as a dispositional base of the fluctuation
pattern of occupational calling, which was predicted because
making a positive and meaningful societal impact is central to
both prosocial motivation and occupational calling. Taken together, by examining situational and personal antecedents of
occupational calling in a unique crisis context, we answered the
call for more research on the causes of occupational calling
(Thompson & Bunderson, 2019).
Finally, we contribute to the calling research by verifying the
importance of occupational calling variability in addition to
average level in predicting job performance. More generally,
our findings suggest that variability in work passion—above
and beyond the average level— has a direct and meaningful
impact on work performance. Our supplementary analyses further showed that occupational calling variability mitigated the
relationship between occupational calling and job performance.
Specifically, the relationship was nonsignificant for nurses with
highly variable occupational calling. While the calling literature
assumes that the higher one’s calling is, the better one’s performance will be (e.g., Kim et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018), our
study suggests that the variability underlying one’s average

We also conducted several supplementary analyses to further inform
the robustness of our findings. Details are reported in Appendix B.

experience a higher and less variable level of occupational
calling over time, leading to higher performance. Organizations
may find value to include prosocial motivation as part of the
selection process or to instill such motivation in job incumbents
through socialization and training activities.
Another implication for practice is that organizations must
endeavor to instill high yet stable levels of calling in employees, rather than employing periodic booster shots that create
temporary peaks in employees’ calling. Although isolated, onetime events can cause spikes in motivation and calling, they are
ultimately less effective if the spikes wane over time. Maintaining high levels of occupational calling will require organizations to pay continuous attention to employee development

level of occupational calling is a key boundary of the occupational calling—job performance linkage. Our findings indicate
that the extant literature needs to adopt calling variability as an
essential construct and unveil the underlying mechanisms for
explaining its complex role in predicting job performance.
In terms of practice, our study suggests that occupational
calling can be evoked by salient societal and occupational
demands. To boost occupational calling, employers can guide
employees’ attention to situational cues that send clear signals
of the needs of others and work meaningfulness. For COVID-19
health care workers in particular, one upside of their challenging daily activities is that, ultimately, these activities provide
short-term boosts in their passion for helping patients. Our
study also suggests that people high in prosocial motivation

for positive societal impact.

Limitations and Future Directions
Due to the unique research context in our study, all nurses were
from a single hospital working in similar units and contexts. It is
unclear whether the effects observed in this study would be of the
same magnitude in other occupations or other (nonpandemic)
contexts. However, our findings are important to medical and
health care professionals who are expected to devote themselves to
fighting infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19.
Second, due to length constraints for the daily surveys, we used
a short measure that asked participants to directly report their sense
of calling on that day. Because the meaning of the term “calling”
was left up to participants, it is possible that some responses may
also capture participants’ perceptions of task significance and
meaningfulness or attributions about their own behavior. However,
the two-item calling scale (Dik et al., 2012; Duffy & Sedlacek,
2007) included in our three-item measure had a sizable correlation
(r ⫽ .48) with Dobrow and Tosti-Kharas’s (2011) more extensively validated calling measure, which provides some supportive
evidence of convergent validity. Still, future research should aim
to replicate our findings with other established calling measures.
Also, we could not operationalize the potential mechanisms that
link the average level and variability of occupational calling to
performance (e.g., increased work effort and greater persistence).
Future research should test them directly.
Third, our findings relied on nurses’ self-reports of daily number of code blue events because we were not permitted to access
the official records of actual numbers from the hospital. Future
research can gain a deeper understanding of how actual versus
perceived events during crises play a role in daily occupational
calling. Moreover, due to the ethics concern of the hospital with
regard to protecting participants and not adding to nurses’
stress, we were not permitted to inquire about the outcomes of
code blue events (i.e., patient mortality information). Nevertheless, it is possible that such outcomes can shape nurses’ calling.
On the one hand, losing a patient may strengthen one’s sense of
calling for a better outcome next time. On the other hand, losing
a patient may weaken one’s sense of calling by reducing nurses’
confidence in their competence to bring about positive societal
impact. Future research should include event outcomes for a
more nuanced picture of the impact of crisis events on daily
occupational calling.
Last, our study was limited to tracking calling and performance
over a 5-day period. Future research may examine a broader range
of cognition and behavior at both within-person and betweenperson levels, such as well-being (Steger & Dik, 2009) and citizenship behaviors (B. G. Xie et al., 2017), to further our understanding of the effects of short-term fluctuations in occupational
calling. Despite these limitations, our study broke new ground in
the occupational calling literature by drawing attention to daily
fluctuations in calling within crisis situations and the impact of
prosocial motivation on these daily fluctuations in occupational
calling.

Cross-Level Moderation Effect of
Prosocial Motivation
We argued that nurses high in prosocial motivation would
consistently have a high level of daily occupational calling,
whereas those low in prosocial motivation would be variable in
daily occupational calling. This argument implies that prosocial
motivation may interact with daily number of code blue events to
predict daily calling. Therefore, we conducted supplementary analyses by testing the cross-level moderation effect of prosocial
motivation. We estimated a multilevel model that added the crosslevel moderation effect of prosocial motivation on the random
slope for daily code blue events predicting daily calling. With the
addition of the cross-level moderation effect, the results for our
hypothesized model remained the same. The interaction effect was
significant (␥ ⫽ ⫺.66, p ⫽ .030). The relationship between daily
code blue events and daily calling was positive (simple slope ⫽
1.00, p ⫽ .003) for nurses lower in prosocial motivation (⫺1 SD),
whereas this relationship was nonsignificant (simple slope ⫽ .16,
p ⫽ .220) for nurses higher in prosocial motivation (⫹1 SD). In

other words, the positive association between daily code blue
events and daily calling was more likely to exist for nurses with
lower levels of prosocial motivation than those with higher levels
of prosocial motivation.

Interaction Effect Between Average Level and
Variability of Occupational Calling
We also explored whether average level and variability of
occupational calling interacted to affect job performance. With the
addition of this Level-2 interaction effect, the results for our
hypothesized model remained the same. The interaction effect was
significant (␥ ⫽ ⫺3.25, p ⫽ .005). The relationship between
average level of occupational calling and job performance was
positive (simple slope ⫽ 3.49, p ⫽ .001) for nurses lower in
occupational calling variability (⫺1 SD), whereas this relationship
was nonsignificant (simple slope ⫽ .74, p ⫽ .563) for nurses
higher in occupational calling variability (⫹1 SD). In other words,
the performance benefit from higher average occupational calling
only existed for those nurses who had lower levels of occupational
calling variability and not for those with higher levels of occupational calling variability.
