We investigate the psychological recovery process of full-time employees during the 2-week period at the
onset of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Past research suggests that recovery processes start
after stressors abate and can take months or years to unfold. In contrast, we build on autonomy restoration
theory to suggest that recovery of impaired autonomy starts immediately even as a stressor is ongoing.
Using growth curve modeling, we examined the temporal trajectories of two manifestations of impaired
autonomy—powerlessness and (lack of) authenticity—to test whether recovery began as the pandemic
unfolded. We tested our predictions using a unique experience-sampling dataset collected over a 2-week
period beginning on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a “global pandemic” by the World Health
Organization and a “national emergency” by the U.S. Government (March 16 –27, 2020). Results suggest
that autonomy restoration was activated even as the pandemic worsened. Employees reported decreasing
powerlessness and increasing authenticity during this period, despite their subjective stress-levels not
improving. Further, the trajectories of recovery for both powerlessness and authenticity were steeper for
employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism, a personality characteristic central to stress reactions.
Importantly, these patterns do not emerge in a second experience-sampling study collected prior to the
COVID-19 crisis (September 9 –20, 2019), highlighting how the pandemic initially threatened employee
autonomy, but also how employees began to recover their sense of autonomy almost immediately. The
present research provides novel insights into employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and
suggests that psychological recovery can begin during a stressful experience.

dollars in government-sponsored economic stimulus aimed at stabilizing the reeling economy after entire industries have come to a halt.
Consequently, nearly all employees have had to abruptly embrace
fundamental changes to their work routines. In a recent survey of U.S.
workers, 69% indicated that COVID-19 was the most stressful time of
their entire professional careers (Glass, 2020).
Stressful circumstances like the COVID-19 crisis can damage
employees’ well-being in general (for a review, see Bliese, Edwards,
& Sonnentag, 2017) but can be specifically harmful to employees’
sense of autonomy (Deci & Ryan, 2008; Ryan & Deci, 2000, 2017).
Indeed, the uncontrollability of one’s economic future (e.g., layoffs,
furloughs), looming threats to physical health (e.g., infection risk,
inadequacy of medical resources), constraints on physical movement
(e.g., stay at home orders, social distancing), and mandatory telecommuting arrangements all serve to threaten employees’ sense of autonomy. Furthermore, although prior work has shown that voluntary
telecommuting can have positive outcomes for employees (Gajendran
& Harrison, 2007), this work also recognizes that mandatory tele-

The COVID-19 pandemic is already considered a generationdefining public health and economic crisis, the full consequences of
which will likely take years to be fully realized. Globally, there are

deaths (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020),1 whereas in the United States,
the pandemic has led to record unemployment rates and trillions of

commuting can have detrimental effects on employees (Lapierre, Van
Steenbergen, Peeters, & Kluwer, 2016). Thus, determining if employees recover their sense of autonomy, over what time period, and
which employees are better/worse equipped to recover, is crucial for
understanding the impact of COVID-19 because “being able to satisfy
the need for autonomy is essential” for employees to flourish (Deci &
Ryan, 2000, p. 242).
To examine these questions, we conducted a 10-day experiencesampling (ESM) study involving working professionals from a
variety of organizations who were thrust into a stressful state
during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data
collection window (March 16 –27, 2020) was uniquely positioned
to observe employees’ experiences in the early stages of the
pandemic as our first daily survey started almost immediately after
the U.S. President declared the pandemic a “national emergency”
(March 13), the U.S. Government issued formal stay-at-home and
social distancing guidelines (March 16), and the Dow Jones Index
recorded its largest point drop in history (March 16; see Figure 1).
Focusing on this unique time period provides novel insights into
how employees recover their autonomy from stressful and traumatic events. Although prior work largely focuses on recovery
after stressors have ended and generally conceptualizes recovery
as a long-term process, our model predicts and finds that employees begin to recover their sense of autonomy (indicated as reduced
powerlessness and increased authenticity) immediately following
the onset of a stressor, even while the stressor is ongoing. In
supplemental analyses, we examine the moderating role of neuroticism and show that although employees higher (vs. lower) in
neuroticism have more extreme initial negative reactions to the
pandemic, consistent with the person-environment fit theory of job
stress (Camacho, Higgins, & Luger, 2003; French, Caplan, &

Harrison, 1982; Shah, Higgins, & Friedman, 1998), they recover
their autonomy at a faster rate.

Theory and Hypotheses
Past work seeking to understand how people recover from
stressful or traumatic events has demonstrated that human beings
are remarkably resilient in the face of stress, as they are equipped
with psychological tools that facilitate recovery (Bonanno, 2004;
Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, Blumberg, & Wheatley, 1998; Martin,
1917). However, past work on psychological recovery is illequipped to explain how employees react to and recover from
sudden and ongoing stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic for
several reasons.
First, the majority of work studying recovery after traumas
documents a recovery process after the stressor has abated (Bonanno, Field, Kovacevic, & Kaltman, 2002; Horgan & MacLachlan, 2004; Shepherd & Haynie, 2011; Updegraff & Taylor,
2000), and even then, studies rarely begin assessing recovery
processes until months or years after the end of the stressor
(Norris, 2006). This research has provided valuable insights into
recovery processes that occur after discrete stressor events end
(Bonanno et al., 2002; Horgan & MacLachlan, 2004; Shepherd &
Haynie, 2011; Updegraff & Taylor, 2000) and stressors that abate
over time (Farber & Egeland, 1987; Masten & Gewirtz, 2006;
Miller, Chen, & Zhou, 2007). However, not all stressors are
experienced as less stressful over time. Some stressors (such as
COVID-19) are characterized by both an immediate onset of acute
stress (e.g., sudden work from home and social distancing orders)
as well as a sustained or increasing level of chronic stress due to
deteriorating circumstances (e.g., exponential increase in infec-

tions and deaths), but prior work is ill-equipped to speak to how
employees may recover from such stressors. Speaking to this
point, scholars have recognized that “undeniably, the field as a
whole has not done very well in capturing the element of time”
(Norris, 2006, p. 182). Building on autonomy restoration theory
(Radel, Pelletier, Sarrazin, & Milyavskaya, 2011), we provide
evidence that employees begin recovering immediately following
the onset of a stressor, even while the stressor is ongoing.
Second, our work departs from past work that has tended to
conceptualize recovery as a slow process (Karstoft, Armour, Elklit,
& Solomon, 2013; Lauterbach & Armour, 2016; Maslow et al.,
2015). Indeed, prior work has primarily focused on long-term
recovery assessed at infrequent intervals (for a review, see
Galatzer-Levy, Huang, & Bonanno, 2018), indicating that recovery unfolds slowly, and that changes are observed over months and
years. Our work, however, demonstrates that recovery is observable in as little as two weeks following the onset of a stressor. This
is an important insight, as scholars have emphasized the need to
better understand the way individuals “experience the crucial early
weeks after an extreme stressor event” (Bonanno, 2005, p. 138).
Finally, past work on recovery processes has prioritized studying indicators of psychological well-being that are relevant to
diagnosing recognized mental disorders (e.g., PTSD, depression,
anxiety, see Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018). Building on autonomy
restoration theory (Radel et al., 2011), we focus on how employees
recover indicators of autonomy (e.g., powerlessness, authenticity)
and demonstrate that these indicators exhibit fundamentally different patterns of recovery compared to more commonly studied
recovery outcomes. Overall, the current work offers novel insights
into the nature and timing of the psychological recovery process
that past work is unable to address.

Autonomy Restoration During an Ongoing Crisis
In the present work, we propose that when employees’ autonomy is threatened by an exogenous stressor (i.e., the COVID-19
pandemic), they will immediately begin to restore their autonomy
even as the stressor is ongoing and objectively intensifying. In
developing our hypotheses, we build on autonomy restoration
theory (Radel et al., 2011), which specifies that the need to restore
one’s autonomy is so fundamental for employees that the process
of restoring autonomy begins “immediately following the experience of an autonomy-depriving event” (Radel et al., 2011, p. 930).
Autonomy is a multidimensional construct (Deci & Ryan, 2012), as
it relates to both “issues of freedom and authenticity” (p. 2). Indeed,
scholars have recently suggested that autonomy is comprised of “the
need to experience one’s self as the author of one’s actions” as well
as the need for the self “to be aligned with one’s personal values and
goals” (Ryan & Ryan, 2019, p. 2). Here, we explore two manifestations of threatened autonomy—powerlessness (defined as lack of
freedom from external constraints; Ashforth & Mael, 1989; De Cremer, Van Dick, & Murnighan, 2011; Mirowsky & Ross, 1983; Seeman, 1972), and reduced authenticity (defined as the belief that one’s
“behaviors are authored by the self, internally caused, and reflect
choice and self-expression”; McConnell et al., 2005, p. 3; Sheldon,
Ryan, Rawsthorne, & Ilardi, 1997). Importantly, both power experiences (Smith & Hofmann, 2016) and authenticity (Lenton, Slabu, &
Sedikides, 2016; Lopez & Rice, 2006; Sedikides, Slabu, Lenton, &
Thomaes, 2017) exhibit substantial day-to-day variance, highlighting

the appropriateness of the experience sampling methodology used in
the current work.
Despite the existence of a vast literature highlighting the importance of autonomy as a fundamental psychological need, comparatively little work has examined how employees respond over time
when confronted with threats to autonomy. According to autonomy
restoration theory (Radel et al., 2011), unmet autonomy needs can
generate a restorative motive whereby individuals react to autonomy
threats by increasing their concern with and efforts to satisfy their
autonomy needs. Specifically, when an individual is deprived of
autonomy, the behavioral schema needed to restore autonomy becomes increasingly accessible (Aarts, Dijksterhuis, & De Vries, 2001;
Seibt, Häfner, & Deutsch, 2007; Strack & Deutsch, 2004). For example, employees may respond to the experience of powerlessness by
engaging in learning activities to extend their skills (e.g., learning how
to use virtual conferencing software such as Zoom) and finding new
ways to exert control over their environment (e.g., by arranging a
home-work space and a new work routine). Similarly, employees may
look for ways to increase their sense of authenticity by, for example,
wearing more comfortable clothing while working or finding new
ways to express one’s personality in a virtual work environment.
These predictions are consistent with work suggesting that when
confronted with constraints and restrictions on freedom, individuals react strongly and work to regain their lost freedom (Bensley &
Wu, 1991; Brehm, 1966; Brehm & Brehm, 1981). However, one
limitation of this work is that “it is hard to say whether the
autonomy restorative response would occur in the same way in real
life settings” as the majority of studies on autonomy restoration
have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments (Radel
et al., 2011, p. 929). We address this shortcoming in the context of
a global pandemic. Specifically, we extend work on the autonomy
restoration process to a real-life context involving a strong threat to
employees’ autonomy by proposing the following hypotheses:
H1: After exposure to an ongoing stressor, powerlessness will
decrease over time.
H2: After exposure to an ongoing stressor, authenticity will
increase over time.

Method
Participants
We invited all of the employees with publicly available e-mail
addresses and job titles from 41 community colleges across a large
state on the West Coast of the U.S. to participate in this study via
e-mail in exchange for an Amazon.com gift card.2 This study was
conducted under IRB Protocol #UP-20 – 00098 at the University of
2
We used a tiered payment schedule to incentivize maximum participation. Specifically, participants received $5.00 for completing the background survey and at least one daily survey, an additional $0.25 for each
unique survey completed, a $1.50 bonus each day for which they completed all of the daily surveys, and an additional $10.00 bonus at the end
of the study if they fully participated in at least 7 out of the 10 days of the
study. Finally, we awarded a $250 bonus payment to one randomly
selected participant at the end of the study who fully participated in at least
7 of the 10 study days. We paid participants in the form of an Amazon.com
gift card code that we emailed to participants at the conclusion of the study.

Southern California (Project Title: “ESM Study of Daily Work
Experiences”). A total of 267 employees accessed and at least
partially completed the background survey and a total of 198
employees completed the entire background survey (described
below). Of those 198 employees, 142 participated in the daily
portion of the study (described below). Employees held positions
such as accounting specialist, director of admissions, and IT manager. Consistent with prior studies using similar designs, we removed participants who did not participate fully in at least three
(out of 10) of the daily surveys (Barnes, Lucianetti, Bhave, &
Christian, 2015; Rosen, Koopman, Gabriel, & Johnson, 2016),
which resulted in an effective sample size of 117 employees
(24.6% male; Mage ⫽ 44.39, SD ⫽ 11.64, 44% response rate).
Participants reported having an average of 22.85 years of work
experience (SD ⫽ 12.64) and working an average of 40.20 hr per
week (SD ⫽ 5.17). During the time period of our data collection,
participants reported working an average of 8.00 hours per day
(SD ⫽ 1.25).
Participants completed a one-time background survey the
week prior to the daily surveys (March 9 –15, 2020), which
included the informed consent release, a measure of neuroticism, as well as demographic information. The daily surveys
were completed over the course of two consecutive work weeks
(March 16 –27, 2020) and were collected as part of a broader
data collection effort. Participants received three surveys (via
e-mail) each workday (Monday–Friday). The first day of the
daily portion of our study (March 16) was the first work day
after the bulk of the closures and shut downs associated with the
COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.3 Each daily survey
captured participants’ momentary powerlessness, momentary
authenticity, and momentary stress about the COVID-19 situation. To minimize retrospective bias (Beal & Weiss, 2003;
Gabriel et al., 2019), the surveys were spaced out throughout
the work-day and sent in the morning (9:30 a.m.), early afternoon (1:00 p.m.), and late afternoon (4:30 p.m.). Because each
survey was designed to capture momentary observations of each
focal construct at a specific point in the workday, we removed
daily observations where participants completed the surveys out
of sequence (n ⫽ 31). In addition, to ensure that our results
were focused on working employees, we removed daily observations where participants reported not working the majority of
the work day (i.e., at least 5 hours; n ⫽ 147),4 as this threshold
has been used in past research to designate full-time employees
(Ehrhardt & Ragins, 2019). Our final sample included 735
person-day observations (62.8% participation rate).

Measures
To minimize response fatigue associated with responding to
three daily surveys over 10 workdays, following recent recommendations for ESM research (Gabriel et al., 2019; Ohly, Sonnentag,
Niessen, & Zapf, 2010), we assessed our focal daily constructs
(powerlessness, authenticity, COVID-19 stress) using single-items
in the morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon of each survey
day.5 Single-item measures can be appropriate when the burden on
respondents is high and the item is face valid and not subject to
idiosyncratic interpretations (Fisher & To, 2012; Gabriel et al.,
2019).

To assess powerlessness, participants responded to the statement, “Right now, I feel powerless” on a scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). To assess authenticity,
participants responded to the statement, “I feel like I am able to
truly be myself right now” on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). To assess COVID-19 stress,
participants responded to the question, “What is your current
stress level regarding the COVID-19 situation?” on a scale
ranging from 1 (not stressed at all) to 5 (very stressed). Because
we expected day-level variance in these constructs, following
the recommendation of Chan (1998) we used an additive model
and calculated the simple day-level mean for each construct.

Results
Descriptive statistics for and correlations among all variables
are presented in Table 1. Given our theoretical interest in exploring
trends over time in powerlessness and authenticity, as well as
whether these trends are different for employees who are higher
(vs. lower) in neuroticism, we tested our hypotheses by estimating
growth curves using random coefficient modeling (RCM; Bliese &
Ployhart, 2002). RCM uses a multilevel approach, with daily
observations nested within employees, and calls for regressing
Level-1 (within-person) variables on time to estimate a slope for
the trajectory of that variable over time. Because our study took
place over 10 consecutive work-days, we included a study day
variable in our model, which took the value of 1–10 and indicated
the study day. RCM allows testing for individual differences in
trajectories over time by regressing the Level-2 (between-person)
slope over time on individual difference variables (Bliese & Ployhart, 2002). Therefore, following the recommendations of the
RCM procedure, at Level-1 (within-person) we estimated random
slopes regressing our focal constructs (powerlessness and authenticity) on time (study day), and then at Level-2 (between-person),

From the week ending March 14, 2020 to the week ending March
28, 2020 in the U.S., the number of COVID-19 related deaths increased
by 5,217% and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased by
5,390%. In addition, initial unemployment claims increased by 1,964%
when comparing our data collection window to the 2-week period
immediately preceding our data collection window, which was the
greatest increase in initial unemployment claims from one 2-week
period to the next since the Labor Department began tracking this
information in 1967.

As a robustness test, we also estimated our model without removing
participants who reported not working the majority of the workday, and the
interpretation of our focal relationships remained unchanged.

Following the recommendations of Gabriel et al. (2019), we conducted a validation study on Mechanical Turk to establish the validity
of our single-item measures (n ⫽ 201, 68.2% male, age M ⫽ 36.17,
SD ⫽ 10.58). Our single-item measure of powerlessness correlated
significantly with the low-power subscale of the sense of power scale
developed by Anderson, John, and Keltner (2012; r ⫽ .85, p ⬍ .01), and
our single-item measure of authenticity correlated significantly with the
state authenticity scale developed by Fleeson and Wilt (2010; r ⫽ .78,

we regressed these random slopes on neuroticism.6,7,8 We estimated a model in Mplus 8.0 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017), in which
we simultaneously estimated the random slopes for powerlessness
and authenticity over time, and the influence of neuroticism on
these trajectories (see Table 2).
Hypothesis 1 predicted that powerlessness would decrease over
time. As predicted, time had a negative influence on powerlessness
(␥ ⫽ ⫺.04, p ⬍ .01), suggesting that employees felt less powerless
over the 10 days (see Figure 2). Hypothesis 2 predicted that
authenticity would increase over this same time period. As predicted, time had a positive influence on authenticity (␥ ⫽ .02, p ⬍
.05), suggesting that employees felt more authentic over the 10
days (see Figure 2).9,10 We followed the procedure described by
Lang, Bliese, and Runge (2019) to calculate likelihood-based R2
statistics, and these analyses indicated that these trends over time
accounted for 10.5% of the variance in powerlessness and 11.1%
of the variance in authenticity.
Although our arguments suggest that the downward trend in
powerlessness and the upward trend in authenticity we observed
are unique to the time period of our data collection during the
COVID-19 crisis, an alternative explanation is that employees
always experience these linear trends independent of the exogenous COVID-19 situation. In addition, an assumption of our model
is that employees living through the COVID-19 pandemic (vs.
employees not living through the pandemic) initially felt more
powerless and less authentic. Therefore, to rule out this alternative
explanation and test the underlying assumptions of our model, we
compared the results of our model to an identical model using data
collected as part of a broader data collection effort well before the
COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., September 9 –20, 2019, see the Appendix for details). We used multigroup analysis in Mplus 8.0
(Muthén & Muthén, 2017) to fit our model onto both data sets, and
then used the model constraint feature to compare the parameters
from the two models. Thus, we were able to approximate a
discontinuous growth model (Bliese & Lang, 2016; Singer &
Willett, 2003), which can “enhance our theoretical understanding
of meta-concepts such as adaptability and resilience” (Bliese,
Adler, & Flynn, 2017, p. 264).
Results indicated that the intercept of powerlessness in the
post-COVID-19 onset data was significantly greater than that in
the pre-COVID-19 onset data (⌬␥ ⫽ .86, p ⬍ .01), and that the
intercept for authenticity in the post-COVID-19 onset data was

significantly lower than that in the pre-COVID-19 onset data
(⌬␥ ⫽ ⫺.49, p ⬍ .01), providing evidence for our assumption that
the crisis caused employees to initially feel more powerless and
less authentic. Next, we compared the trajectories over time for
powerlessness and authenticity between the two data sets. There
was no significant temporal trend in either powerlessness (␥ ⫽ .01,
ns) or authenticity (␥ ⫽ ⫺.01, ns) in the pre-COVID-19 onset
dataset, and the temporal trajectories in both powerlessness
(⌬␥ ⫽ ⫺.05, p ⬍ .01) and authenticity (⌬␥ ⫽ .03, p ⬍ .05) were
significantly stronger in the post-COVID-19 onset dataset compared to the pre-COVID-19 onset dataset (see Figure 2). Consistent with our theorizing, these results provide additional evidence
that the temporal trajectories of powerlessness and authenticity
observed in our focal dataset are unique to the time period associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.

As a robustness test, we ran supplemental models following the steps
outlined by Bliese and Ployhart (2002) to account for autocorrelation and
heteroscedasticity. The interpretation of all focal relationships remained
unchanged in these models, suggesting that autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity are not exerting a meaningful influence on our results.
8
According to Bliese and Ployhart (2002), one of the prerequisites for
using RCM to explore growth curves is that there must be significant
Level-2 variance to necessitate multilevel modeling. Therefore, following
these recommendations, prior to estimating our models we calculated
intraclass correlations (ICCs) for each of our daily variables to ensure that
the assumptions of the RCM procedure were met. These results indicated
that for powerlessness (ICC1⫽.59), authenticity (ICC1⫽.73), and
COVID-19 stress (ICC1⫽.76), there was substantial between-person variance to necessitate multilevel modeling.

According to Bliese and Ployhart (2002) additional validity for support
of a linear temporal trend can be found by also testing curvilinear effects
to ensure that the linear trend is not mis-specified. Therefore, we estimated
a supplemental model where we included time as well as a fixed slope for
time squared as predictors of both powerlessness and authenticity. In these
supplemental analyses, the square term was nonsignificant for both powerlessness and authenticity, providing additional confidence in the conclusion that there is a linear trend in both over time.

Supplemental Analysis
An alternative explanation for our findings is that employees’
stress was decreasing over time in a way that made them feel less
powerless and more authentic. To test this possibility, we used the
RCM procedure (Bliese & Ployhart, 2002) to estimate a growth
curve for COVID-19 stress over the 10 days of our study. Results
suggested that COVID-19 stress was not decreasing over the
course of the 10 days of our study, as the linear trend was positive
and significant (␥ ⫽ .09, p ⬍ .01).11 The daily values of
COVID-19 stress, as well as the daily values of powerlessness and
authenticity, are presented in Figure 2, and demonstrate that although powerlessness was decreasing and authenticity was increasing over time, employees’ stress was not decreasing. In
addition, as presented in Figure 1, the objective situation was
worsening over the time frame of our study, yet employees were
feeling less powerless and more authentic during this time. These
results indicate that both subjectively and objectively the
COVID-19 situation was not improving during the time frame of
our data collection.
To provide additional insights into the way employees recovered during the COVID-19 crisis, we also explored how employees’ neuroticism influenced their powerlessness and authenticity
during this time period. Neuroticism reflects the extent to which
individuals tend to be nervous, anxious, depressed, self-conscious,
and vulnerable (Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003; John & Srivastava, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 1991) and has been linked to a
wide range of negative psychological (Clark, Watson, & Mineka,
1994; Spijker et al., 2008) and physical health outcomes (Neeleman, Ormel, & Bijl, 2001; Rosmalen, Neeleman, Gans, & de
Jonge, 2007). Despite these apparent drawbacks of neuroticism,
scholars also acknowledge conditions under which neuroticism
can be adaptive. Friedman (2000) proposed the concept of “healthy
neuroticism,” which emphasizes the functional benefits associated
with vigilance and worrying in dangerous environments (Craske,
1999; Janis, 1958; Lahey, 2009; Matthews, Deary, & Whiteman,
2003). However, the benefits of neuroticism likely accrue over
time as a stressful situation plays out and vigilance becomes
increasingly valued and rewarded. Thus, it is “also important to
consider neuroticism in terms of what occurs after a disease or
special challenge” (Friedman, 2019, p. 27).
According to the person-environment fit theory of job stress
(French et al., 1982), an individual’s level of psychological, physiological, and behavioral strain following exposure to a stressor is
determined by the fit between personal characteristics (e.g., traits,

values, abilities) and their environment (Edwards & Cooper,
1990). Indeed, Tamir (2005) suggested that “despite their unpleasant nature, negative states may be beneficial for individuals high in
neuroticism” (p. 450). This is because neurotic individuals in
particular are able to recognize and leverage the instrumental
benefits of experiencing trait-consistent negative affect (Tamir,
2005), allowing them to resolve confusion and make evaluative
distinctions more efficiently (Tamir & Robinson, 2004). For these
reasons, we propose that employees who are higher (vs. lower) in
neuroticism will be better psychologically equipped to navigate an
inherently stressful environment and thus recover their sense of
autonomy at a faster rate.
We measured employees’ neuroticism in the background survey
using the two neuroticism items from the 10-item personality
inventory (TIPI, Gosling et al., 2003). Items included “I am
anxious, easily upset” and “I am calm, emotionally stable” (reverse
coded). The scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree). The correlation coefficient for these two items was 0.48
(p ⬍ .01). Past work has demonstrated convergent validity between the TIPI and the other established measures of neuroticism
(Ehrhart et al., 2009; Furnham, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2006, see
also Jonason, Teicher, & Schmitt, 2011).
Results indicated that neuroticism had a significant moderating
effect on the trajectory of powerlessness over time (␥ ⫽ ⫺.03, p ⬍
.05). Following the recommendation of Cohen, Cohen, West, and
Aiken (2003), we plotted this temporal trajectory at higher (⫹1
SD) and lower (⫺1 SD) levels of neuroticism. Figure 3 demonstrates that the downward trend in powerlessness over time was
stronger for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism. Neuroticism also had a significant effect on the intercept of powerlessness
(␥ ⫽ .43, p ⬍ .01), meaning that on Day 1 of the study employees
higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism felt more powerless. Overall,
although employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism initially felt
more powerless, over time their feelings of powerlessness abated
at a faster rate.
Results indicated that neuroticism also had a significant moderating effect on the trajectory of authenticity over time (␥ ⫽ .03,
p ⬍ .01). Figure 4 depicts this temporal trajectory plotted at higher
(⫹1 SD) and lower (⫺1 SD) levels of neuroticism and demonstrates that the upward trend in authenticity over time was stronger
11
Following the recommendation of Bliese and Ployhart (2002), we also
estimated a curvilinear term by including time squared as a predictor of
COVID stress, and this parameter was significant (␥ ⫽ ⫺.01, p ⬍ .01).

for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism. In addition,
neuroticism had a significant effect on the intercept of authenticity
(␥ ⫽ ⫺.41, p ⬍ .01), indicating that although employees higher
(vs. lower) in neuroticism initially felt less authentic, over time
their sense of authenticity increased at faster rate.12

General Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis of unprecedented severity
and scope. In the present work, we leveraged a unique empirical
context and historical moment in time to offer insights into the
psychological recovery process during an ongoing crisis. Our
10-day experience sampling study, spanning arguably the most
physically, economically, and psychologically threatening period
in recent memory, revealed that employees experienced a decreased sense of powerlessness and an increased sense of authenticity over time, and that this recovery process was stronger for

is ⫺1 SD.

employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism. Interestingly, these
effects emerged while neither the objective situation nor the subjective stress reactions to it were improving. This pattern of results
highlights the possibility that psychological recovery may begin
even before an ongoing stressful experience abates. In addition,
comparing the temporal trends observed for powerlessness and
authenticity to the trajectory of COVID-19 stress during this initial
time period highlights the uniqueness of the recovery patterns
associated with manifestations of autonomy, and demonstrates that
not all manifestations of well-being recover in the same way.
Our findings make several important contributions to the stress,
power, and authenticity literatures in general and to the field’s
understanding of reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. First, we are among the first to consider the psychological
impact of COVID-19 on employees and, to our knowledge, the
first to do so in the context of a rigorous ESM study involving
working professionals living through the early days of the pandemic. In doing so, our findings answer recent calls for more
organizational research on natural disasters because “contagious
disease outbreaks have been given short shrift” (Rao & Greve,
2018, p. 20).
Second, we contribute to research on the psychological recovery
process (e.g., Barling, Bluen, & Fain, 1987; Hulme & Shepherd,
2003; Pratt & Barling, 1987; Harkness & Monroe, 2016), which
has primarily assumed that individuals start to recover from stressful events and traumatic experiences after the stressor abates or
disappears altogether. In contrast, our findings suggest that individuals start to recover before the traumatic conditions associated
with a stressor begin to abate. In doing so, we are among the first
12
In a supplemental model, we also estimated the effect of neuroticism
on the trajectory of COVID stress over time. Results indicated that neuroticism did not have a significant effect on the trajectory (␥ ⫽ ⫺.03, ns)
of COVID stress.

to provide field data in support of Radel et al.’s (2011) autonomy
restoration theory. Understanding the nature and timing of psychological recovery exhibited by employees is important because
society’s capacity and willingness to return to normal is partially
dependent on employees across a wide range of roles and organizations feeling sufficiently autonomous and empowered to carry
out their job functions effectively (Deci & Ryan, 2000).
Third, our findings contribute to the field’s understanding of the
psychology of powerlessness (Schaerer, du Plessis, Yap, & Thau,
2018). Scholars have noted that the study of power(lessness) has
been limited to context-deprived experiments or static survey
research (Antonakis & Sturm, 2015; Schaerer, Lee, Galinsky, &
Thau, 2018) and that “it is unclear how power is experienced by
individuals on a daily basis [. . .] and to what extent individuals
fluctuate in their level of power” over time (Smith & Hofmann,
2016, p. 10043). We address these issues by assessing how employees’ experienced powerlessness evolves over time after a
sudden loss of autonomy.
Finally, our finding that neuroticism moderates the effect of
time on feelings of powerlessness and authenticity cautions against
endorsing a universally negative view of neuroticism which “ignore[s] the situational contexts and longitudinal trajectories” that
are relevant to complex stressors (Friedman, 2019, p. 27). In
addition, our study empirically responds to Sedikides et al.’s
(2017, p. 524) question posed to future researchers: “Are some
people more likely than others to experience authenticity in the
face of adversity?” Specifically, by showing that more (vs. less)
neurotic people recover from thwarted autonomy at a faster rate,
we provide an initial temporal perspective on how personality
traits affect the psychological recovery process.
We also note several limitations of the current work. One
limitation of our study is the uniqueness of the context within
which we observed our findings. Although a global pandemic is
not characteristic of a typical work environment, this extraordinary
event allowed us to uncover novel insights into the functioning of
employees’ psychological immune system that are hard to study
under normal circumstances. Indeed, organizational scholars have
suggested that extreme situations and critical incidents are ideal
research settings as psychological processes become “transparently observable” (Pettigrew, 1988, cited in Eisenhardt, 1989, p.
537) and tend to be “more visible than they might be in other

contexts” (Pratt, 2000, p. 458). In addition, employees may experience (milder) ongoing stressful situations that limit their autonomy on a regular basis (e.g., ongoing rounds of layoffs, economic
recessions, difficult interpersonal relationships) in which case the
present effects may play out in a similar, but less pronounced way.
Second, although our supplemental analyses provide evidence
that the patterns observed in the post-COVID-19 onset dataset
were unique compared to the patterns observed in the preCOVID-19 onset dataset, we acknowledge that these samples were
comprised of different employees and not all measures in the two
data sets were identical. The unexpected emergence of the virus
limited our ability to design a study to directly compare pre- and
post-COVID data collected from the same employees, but we feel
that the comparison between the two data sets provides some
benefits in interpreting the results of our model. That said, we
recognize this limitation, and encourage future research to extend
our findings using a pre/post design in the context of other complex stressors. Relatedly, our 10-day study prevents us from drawing inferences over longer periods of time, and we encourage
future work to extend our findings in this way, and to explore
recovery over more granular time periods (e.g., minutes, hours).
Third, although our work demonstrates that employees recover
autonomy immediately following the onset of an ongoing stressor,
our work is not able to provide insights into the specific behaviors
that employees engaged in to do so. Prior research has indicated
that there are a variety of behaviors employees may engage in
following stressful work situations, including detachment, relaxation, fostering a sense of mastery, and reestablishing control
(Sonnentag & Fritz, 2007), and we encourage future research to
build upon these insights to better understand what employees do
to recover autonomy. More generally, building on our findings
related to the moderating role of neuroticism, future work could
examine how reactions to stress can be influenced by personal
dispositions, features of the event, and characteristics of the environment (Harvey, 1996). Finally, it would be useful to examine the
consequences of recovering from an impaired sense of autonomy.
For example, feeling less powerless and more authentic may
eventually reduce employees’ subjective stress levels relating to
the stressor.
The current historical moment may be poised to give way to the
emergence of a new psychology of COVID-19 stress in the same
way that Hall (1917, p. 12) noted that “we shall surely have a new
and larger psychology of war” following WWI. We hope that our
early exploration can contribute to this endeavor and spur additional work in this important and timely area of inquiry.

Sample
We invited full-time working adults enrolled in a part-time MBA
program at a large mid-Atlantic university to participate in the study,
and participants were offered extra credit in their course as well as a
personalized feedback report for their participation. Participants were
informed about the study by their instructors during class time, and
then emailed a link to the background survey and instructed to
complete the background survey to opt into the study. This study was
conducted under IRB Protocol #1471635–2 at the University of
Maryland (Project Title: “Daily Work Perceptions and Behaviors”).
One hundred and five individuals expressed interest in the study by
completing the background survey, and 101 individuals completed the
daily portion of the study. Similar to our main study, and consistent
with prior research using designs similar to ours (Barnes et al., 2015;
Rosen et al., 2016) we removed participants who did not participate
fully in at least three (out of 10) days of the daily portion of the study,
which resulted in an effective sample size of 95 employees (57.9%
male; Mage ⫽ 31.56, SD ⫽ 6.58, 90.5% response rate). Participants
reported having an average of 9.68 years of work experience (SD ⫽

6.36) and working an average of 42.52 hr per week (SD ⫽ 7.84).
During the time period of our data collection, participants reported
working an average of 8.67 hr per day (SD ⫽ 1.97).
Participants completed the one-time background survey the
week prior to completing the daily surveys (September 2– 8,
2019), which included the informed consent release, a measure
of neuroticism, as well as demographic information. The daily
surveys were completed over the course of two consecutive
work weeks (September 9 –20, 2019). Participants received
three surveys (via e-mail) each work-day (Monday-Friday). The
morning survey was sent at 8:00 am, the early afternoon survey
was sent at 1:30 p.m., and the late afternoon survey was sent at
4:00 p.m. Each survey captured participants’ momentary powerlessness, and the late afternoon survey captured participants’
daily authenticity. Similar to our focal study, we removed
day-level observations where participants took surveys out of
sequence or reported not working the majority of the work-day
(i.e., at least 5 hr), resulting in a final sample size of 656
person-day observations (69.1% participation rate).

Measures

Daily powerlessness. To assess powerlessness, participants
were asked to respond to the question “Right now, I feel powerless” on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree), three times during the workday (morning, early afternoon,
and late afternoon; ICC1 ⫽ .69).
Daily authenticity. We measured daily authenticity in the late
afternoon survey using three items adapted from the scale developed by Fleeson and Wilt (2010). Participants responded to each
item on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree), and items included “Today at work, I felt true to myself”,

943

“Today at work, I felt authentic”, and “Today at work, I felt like
I was really being me” (␣ ⫽ .96; ICC1 ⫽ .53).
Dispositional neuroticism. We measured employees’ neuroticism in the background survey using the two-item TIPI scale
(Gosling et al., 2003). The scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree). Items included “I am anxious, easily upset”
and “I am calm, emotionally stable” (reverse coded). The correlation coefficient for these two items was .52 (p ⬍ .01).
