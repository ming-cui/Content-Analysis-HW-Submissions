Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disruptive event devastating to the workplace and the global
community. Drawing on terror management theory, we develop and test a model that explains how
COVID-19-triggered mortality salience influences employees’ state anxiety and their responses at and
outside work. We conducted an experience sampling method study using employees from an information
technology firm in China when COVID-19 was surging there and two experiments using employees from
a variety of industries in the United States when it became a new epicenter of the global outbreak. Results
from 3 studies largely supported our theoretical hypotheses. Specifically, our research showed that
mortality salience concerning COVID-19 was positively related to employees’ state anxiety (general
anxiety in Study 1 and Study 2 and death-specific anxiety in Study 3). Our studies also found that servant
leadership is particularly crucial in guiding employees with state anxiety associated with COVID-19
mortality salience to be engaged in their jobs and to contribute more to the broader community. Our
findings offer timely, valuable implications for theory and practice.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a contagious respiratory
illness, is an ongoing, global health crisis, and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War II (United Nations, 2020).
With the numbers of infections and deaths on the rise, this crisis
has begun to take its toll on the economy, companies, and their
employees. This global crisis endangers our lives and livelihoods,
generating tremendous uncertainty and unpredictability. Millions
of nonessential workers must work from home and experience

increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, which can affect individual behaviors at and outside work.
The profound impact of this crisis triggers several essential yet
unanswered questions in organizational management research.
First, as a global virus that has affected millions and killed hundreds of thousands, COVID-19 is terrifying. Terror management
research has informed us that experiential reminders of mortality
can invoke feelings of anxiety, harming well-being (Burke, Martens, & Faucher, 2010; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon,
1986). We then ask, as a mortality cue, how is COVID-19 affecting employees’ feelings and behaviors? Second, the COVID-19
crisis has been emotionally stressful for individuals, with significant shifts in lives and livelihoods, and the next phases offer
profound uncertainty. Scholars suggested that death exposure triggers feelings of anxiety, activates self-protective, withdrawal behaviors, and decreases job engagement (Grant & Wade-Benzoni,
2009; Sliter, Sinclair, Yuan, & Mohr, 2014). However, other
researchers argued that it encourages people to put life in perspective, overcome obstacles, and provide more help for others (Salzman, 2001; Yuan et al., 2019). So, the next question becomes,
under what conditions does anxiety activated by COVID-19 mortality salience affect job engagement and prosocial behavior?
Third, terror management research indicates that feeling valued
can buffer the negative influences of anxiety associated with
mortality salience (Greenberg et al., 1986). Employees do not face

challenges alone during the crisis. At the workplace, leaders play
vital roles in reducing the potential costs of anxiety related to
deaths in a crisis (Bligh, Kohles, & Meindl, 2004). COVID-19 has
reeled the economy and sounded the alarm for a tough leadership
test: What can leaders do to help employees navigate the anxiety
and keep them engaged?
In this research, we seek to provide insight into these issues by
drawing on terror management theory (TMT) to develop a model (see
Figure 1) to understand the influences of the current pandemic on
employee job engagement and prosocial behavior. We test the overall
relationships in three studies with different designs (a daily diary
study and two experiments) and samples from two countries (China

and the United States) when COVID-19 cases were surging there. The
combination of the daily diary study and experiments from two
countries supports both the external and internal validity of our
hypotheses. We aim to make three contributions. First, our research
uses COVID-19, a catastrophic event, as an empirical referent to
directly test the core tenet of TMT (Greenberg et al., 1986) and
applies the theory to the workplace, an area with relatively limited
attention in this field (Grant & Wade-Benzoni, 2009; Jonas, Kauffeld,
Sullivan, & Fritsche, 2011). Second, we identify anxiety as a critical
psychological mechanism that explains the negative impact of mortality cues on job engagement (Sliter et al., 2014) and how mortality
salience can simultaneously affect both workplace (i.e., job engage-

ment) and community (i.e., prosocial behavior) responses. Third, we
extend terror management research by stressing the need for servant
leadership in times of crisis, in which social distancing physically
separates employees. Servant leadership, defined as leader behaviors
that prioritize the needs of employees and other stakeholders in the
broader community (Greenleaf, 1970), is particularly valuable to keep
anxious employees engaged at work and promote their prosocial
behaviors (Grant, 2020).

Theory and Hypothesis Development
TMT provides an appropriate theoretical framework to understand
potentially life-threatening events (Pyszczynski, 2004). A core tenet
of TMT describes that mortality salience creates debilitating anxiety
(i.e., the “terror” in the TMT negatively affects overall psychological
well-being; Greenberg et al., 1986) because reminders of the inevitable death are at odds with humans’ instinct to survive. TMT further
posits that anxiety activates individuals’ motivation to cope with this
terror, and one’s sense of personal value is a vital coping resource
(Greenberg & Arndt, 2012). As the COVID-19 death toll continues to
rise by day, this looming health crisis sends people frequent reminders
of mortality. The COVID-19 crisis provides an extreme emotional
context within which to study the influence of mortality salience on
employees’ responses.

COVID-19-Triggered Mortality Salience and
State Anxiety
Anxiety lies at the heart of TMT (Juhl & Routledge, 2016).
Mounting evidence has supported the anxiety-provoking effect of

mortality salience (Burke et al., 2010). Research shows that when
people are primed with life’s fragility, they experience not just
death-specific anxiety but also general state anxiety (Belmi &
Pfeffer, 2016; Greenberg et al., 1995; Juhl, 2019; Juhl & Routledge, 2016). State anxiety is “a state of distress and/or physiological arousal in reaction to stimuli, including novel situations and
the potential for undesirable outcomes” (Brooks & Schweitzer,
2011, p. 44). COVID-19 is a deadly disease that raises mortality
salience. At the same time, as the situation evolves, COVID-19triggered mortality salience may vary from day to day and person
to person. When individuals are reminded of mortality in this
deadly crisis, they face paralyzing terror, and experience increased
nervousness, uncertainty, and apprehension about both their lives
and their livelihoods at the moment and in the future, all of which
lead to increased overall state anxiety (Belmi & Pfeffer, 2016;
Brooks & Schweitzer, 2011). Thus, we propose the following:
Hypothesis 1: COVID-19-triggered mortality salience is positively related to state anxiety.

Responses to COVID-19 Mortality Salience and
Servant Leadership as a Moderator
TMT notes that mortality salience-triggered anxiety increases
individuals’ motivation to respond in the hopes to quell this terror
(Greenberg et al., 1986). Although TMT does not directly address
employees’ behaviors at and outside work, we build on and
broaden the theory to discuss the influences of anxiety associated
with mortality salience on both the workplace (i.e., job engagement) and community (i.e., prosocial behavior) responses.

intraclass correlation coefficient. ICC1 is calculated as: (between-person variance)/(between-person variance ⫹ within-person variance). As Aguinis, Gottfredson, and Culpepper (2013) noted, in
interpreting effect size of cross-level interaction effects using multilevel modeling, R2 “can be counterintuitive, such as pseudo R2 values becoming smaller when predictors are added to the model”
(p. 1518). Similarly, Snijders and Bosker (2012) noted that the computation of R2 in multilevel modeling “now and then leads to unpleasant surprises.” (p. 109). Lang, Bliese, and Runge (2020) noted
that a solution to the R2 problem in multilevel mixed-effect models is to calculate likelihood-R2 statistic, which is based on the sample size and likelihood ratio. This likelihood ratio is unfortunately
unavailable in the Bayesian MSEM output. Thus, following Aguinis et al. (2013) and Lang et al. (2020), although we reported R2 values in the cross-level interactions, we would like to point that the
meaning of these values needs to be interpreted cautiously. We reported deviance information criterion (DIC), a Bayesian estimation of Akaike information criterion (AIC) in maximum likelihood
estimation, to assess model fit. Models with smaller DIC are preferable than models with larger DIC (Muthén, 2010). The decrease in DIC from Model 1 to Model 2 indicates that the addition of the
cross-level interaction terms of within-person state anxiety and between-person servant leadership improved the model fit. By default, SEM function fixes the latent variable intercepts to zero. Mplus
output typically provided the p values as one-tailed in Bayesian analyses. For all codes and outputs of Mplus, see online supplemental materials.

State Anxiety

Figure 2. The interaction effect of perceived servant leadership and state
anxiety on job engagement in Study 1.

The implication for job engagement. According to terror
management research, people have different ways of responding
to thoughts of death and their associated anxiety (Lykins,
Segerstrom, Averill, Evans, & Kemeny, 2007). In general, anxiety
activated by COVID-19-triggered mortality salience may lead to
rumination over this crisis (Forgas, 1998) and self-protective,
avoidant, defensive behaviors (Fredrickson, 2001; Kouchaki &
Desai, 2015) such that people can function without being overwhelmed by the anxiety (Grant & Wade-Benzoni, 2009). In the
workplace, a way of self-protection and withdrawal at work is to
reduce devotion physically, emotionally, and cognitively to work
roles (i.e., job engagement; Kahn, 1990). When employees experience intense anxiety, they tend to have impaired information
processing (Gino, Brooks, & Schweitzer, 2012), succumb to work
slowdowns and distractions (Eysenck & Byrne, 1992), and possess
a weaker motivation to engage at work. However, TMT also posits
that the detrimental consequences of anxiety associated with mortality cues can be mitigated when people have strong psychological resources, such as feeling the purpose and meaning of life
(Greenberg et al., 1986). Greenberg and Arndt (2012) stated,
“Encouraging people to consider our shared humanity is a promising avenue to reducing destructive effects” (p. 411).
In the COVID-19 crisis, leaders who are attentive to employees’
emotional needs and unite them behind a common purpose appear
crucial in shaping employees’ responses (Mainiero & Gibson,
2003). As a leadership approach grounded in other-orientation,
servant leadership exemplifies behaviors prioritizing fulfillment of
others’ needs, attention to employees’ emotional suffering, empowerment, and serving the community (Greenleaf, 1970; Liden,
Wayne, Zhao, & Henderson, 2008). We propose that compared
with other more top-down approaches such as transformational
leadership, servant leaders appear more effective in reducing the
negative influences of state anxiety during COVID-19 on job
engagement because they lead from the bottom and place a primary emphasis on promoting the growth of employees (van
Dierendonck, 2011). First, instead of ignoring anxiety associated
with the crisis, servant leaders likely acknowledge their uncertainties and worries (Isabella, 1990; Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, & Welbourne, 1999), empathize with employees’ anxiety, and provide
affirmation of their confidence in their employees. When leaders
care about employee well-being, anxious employees may feel that

they are valuable contributors at work and are more willing to
invest adequately in their work roles (Rich, Lepine, & Crawford,
2010). Second, because of their attention to employees’ needs,
servant leaders show more understanding of anxious employees’
situations and provide additional resources and autonomy for them
to navigate the situation. This increased control, in turn, reduces
the negative influences of employees’ state anxiety on their job
engagement (Kahn, 1990). Indeed, Cheng and McCarthy (2018)
suggested that transient feelings of anxiety can have reduced
cognitive interference and increased reflective self-regulation to
engage in work roles if employees have additional emotional
resources and enriched skills. Integrating the above statements that
COVID-19-triggered mortality salience increases state anxiety and
that servant leadership reduces the costs of state anxiety on job
engagement, we propose:
Hypothesis 2: The indirect relationship between COVID-19triggered mortality salience and job engagement through state
anxiety is less negative when servant leadership is higher than
when servant leadership is lower.
The implication for prosocial behavior. In terms of community behaviors, terror management research suggests that anxiety
related to mortality salience urges people to repair self-worth by
giving more donations to charities (Greenberg, Solomon, & Arndt,
2008; Jonas, Schimel, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 2002; Zaleskiewicz, Gasiorowska, & Kesebir, 2015) or by helping others (Belmi
& Pfeffer, 2016; Cozzolino, 2006; Lykins et al., 2007; Vail et al.,
2012). But evidence also shows that anxiety does not lead to
prosocial behaviors if people do not see common humanity between themselves and those needing help (Hirschberger, Ein-Dor,
& Almakias, 2008; Jonas et al., 2002). We thus propose that
servant leaders amplify the positive effect of state anxiety resulting
from COVID-19-triggered mortality salience on prosocial behavior. Specifically, unlike other employee-oriented leadership behaviors such as consideration, servant leaders focus broadly on the
community and create a culture inspiring employees to serve
people outside work (Liden, Wayne, Liao, & Meuser, 2014). When
employees feel a deepened sense of humanity and community,
their anxiety is more likely to direct their attention to crisiscentered problems, connecting with victims and prompting action
to alleviate others’ suffering (Williams & Shepherd, 2016).

Study 1
Method
Sample and procedure. We collected data from an information technology company in Eastern China after Wei He learned
from an executive contact of this company that employees would
return to work during this crisis.1 To reflect the daily evolving
COVID-19 situation, we collected data over three weeks with an
online entry survey followed by daily surveys for 10 consecutive
workdays. After explaining the research procedure and incentives,
we invited all 270 employees of the company to participate in our
study. In total, 163 employees completed the entry survey, including measures of demographics and servant leadership. The daily
surveys were sent to these 163 participants twice a day. The noon
survey was sent at 12 a.m. and included the measure of perceived
COVID-19-triggered mortality salience, and the evening survey
was sent at 6 p.m. and included measures of state anxiety, job
engagement, and prosocial behavior. Participants’ surveys were
matched using their web IDs. We paid each participant 150 RMB
(22 USD) for full participation. From the 152 employees who
completed the diary surveys, we received 1,484 matched day-level
data points (out of a total possible of 1,630 from 163 invited
participants) for a valid response rate of 91%. In the final sample,
53.9% were women, 85.5% received college or above education,
the average age was 28.1 (SD ⫽ 5.0), and the average company
tenure was 2.4 years (SD ⫽ 1.9). Participants came from various
departments of the company, such as research and development,
marketing, and human resources.
Measures. Because the original measures were all in English,
we followed a translation-back-translation procedure (Brislin,
1986) by two bilingual management researchers. The disagreement
was resolved through further discussion. The translated surveys
were also sent to several managers in the company, and small
modifications were made based on their feedback. Participated
employees rated the measures with a 7-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 (strong disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) unless otherwise
noted. We measured COVID-19-triggered mortality salience with
both objective (daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths) and subjective

indicators. Daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths were obtained from
daily morning reports by each city’s health department. Employees
rated perceived COVID-19-triggered mortality salience with two
items adapted from Grant, Franklin, and Langford (2002) (e.g.,
“Today, I frequently examined my feelings about COVID-19
related deaths”). Employees rated state anxiety with three items
from Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988; e.g., “nervous”, 1 ⫽ not
at all to 7 ⫽ very much); job engagement with a nine-item scale
from Schaufeli, Bakker, and Salanova (2006) (e.g., “Today, I felt
strong and vigorous at my job”); prosocial behavior with three
items from Rodell (2013) (e.g., “Today, I gave my time to help a
volunteer group”); and perceived servant leadership with a 7-item
scale from Liden et al. (2015; e.g., “My supervisor makes my
career development a priority”). We controlled for employee age,
gender (0 ⫽ male, 1 ⫽ female), and education because of their
potential influences on individuals’ responses to mortality salience
(Burke et al., 2010). Also, we included whether a family member
was affected till the day (0 ⫽ no, 1 ⫽ yes) and work mode (0 ⫽
work from home, 1 ⫽ work in the office) at the daily level. At the
person level, we controlled for the city of residence by creating
two city dummies with the city of Wuhan being the comparison
group, and statistical methods to count for confirmed cases2 because of their impact on the self-relevance of and exposure to
COVID-19-triggered mortality salience (Grant & Wade-Benzoni,
2009). Following recommendations for analyzing diary data, we
controlled for previous-day job engagement and prosocial behavior (Ohly, Sonnentag, Niessen, & Zapf, 2010).

Results
Table 1 presents basic statistics and correlations among the
variables. We first conducted confirmatory factor analyses using
Mplus 8.3 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2017) to validate the discriminant validity of the scale measures. The five-factor measurement
model provided a satisfactory fit to the data (␹2 ⫽ 923.33, df ⫽ 355,

In conducting Study 1, we complied with all guidelines for the ethical
treatment of human subjects at Nanjing University where Wei He worked.
Wei He, who was not affiliated with the participating company, collected
the data.

National Health Commission of China had changed the statistical
method for identifying new COVID-19 cases since February 13, so we
created a dummy variable (statistical method; 0 ⫽ old method, 1 ⫽ new
method). Items for all measures can be found in the online supplementary
materials.

A). We then conducted a multilevel structural equation model
(MSEM) with a Bayesian estimation method (Bolstad & Curran,
2007). The Bayesian method shows advantages over conventional
testing because it allows more direct interpretations of findings
based on the observed data, appropriately estimates more complex
models, and generates credibility intervals (CI) to accurately
assess the non-normally distributed conditional indirect effects
(Kruschke, Aguinis, & Joo, 2012; Muthén, 2010; Simon, Hurst,
Kelley, & Judge, 2015; Zyphur & Oswald, 2015).3 We standardized the official counts of daily death cases for better interpretation. We person-mean centered the subjective indicator of COVID19-triggered mortality salience, and grand-mean centered daily
confirmed COVID-19 deaths, which have significant between-city
variances, and the between-person moderator of servant leadership
(Preacher, Zyphur, & Zhang, 2010). We also person-mean centered all other predictors at the within-person level and grandmean centered other predictors at the between-person level. We
modeled the effects of dependent variables on the mediator with
random slopes and other effects with fixed slopes (see Appendix
B).
As shown in Model 1 of Table 2, state anxiety was not related
to daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths (B ⫽ .06, p ⫽ .12) but
positively related to perceived COVID-19-triggered mortality salience (B ⫽ .29, p ⬍ .001), partially supporting Hypothesis 1.
Moreover, in Model 2, the cross-level interaction of state anxiety
and perceived servant leadership was positively related to job
engagement (B ⫽ .29, p ⬍ .001). Figure 2 showed that the
relationship between state anxiety and job engagement was less
negative when perceived servant leadership was higher (B ⫽ ⫺.05,
p ⫽ .30) than when it was lower (B ⫽ ⫺.52, p ⬍ .001). Results
further indicated that the indirect relationship of perceived

COVID-19-triggered mortality salience with job engagement via
state anxiety was less negative (difference ⫽ .13, 95% CI [.052,
.239]) when perceived servant leadership was higher (B ⫽ ⫺.01,
95% CI [⫺.070, .043]) than when it was lower (B ⫽ ⫺.15, 95% CI
[⫺.236, ⫺.080]), supporting Hypothesis 2. Furthermore, the interaction term was also positively related to prosocial behavior (B ⫽
.19, p ⫽ .01).4 Figure 3 showed that the relationship between state
anxiety and prosocial behavior was more positive (B ⫽ .25, p ⫽
.01) when perceived servant leadership was higher than when it
was lower (B ⫽ ⫺.05, p ⫽ .28). The indirect relationship between
perceived COVID-19-triggered mortality salience and prosocial
behavior via state anxiety was more positive (difference ⫽ .09,
95% CI [.013, .176]) when perceived servant leadership was
higher (B ⫽ .07, 95% CI [.015, .138]) than when it was lower
(B ⫽ ⫺.01, 95% CI [⫺.069, .034]). Thus, Hypothesis 3 was
supported. In sum, our hypotheses were supported when COVID19-triggered mortality salience was subjectively but not objectively measured. This finding is not surprising because we were
unsure if participants had seen the death reports each morning
before completing daily surveys. Because this was a diary study in
China, the causality of the relationships and generalizability to a
different culture remain unclear. To address these limitations, we
designed an online experiment in the United States to replicate the
findings.
3
The Bayesian MSEM analysis produces largely similar results as the
conventional path-analysis via Mplus and the Monte-Carlo bootstrapping
approach with the open-source software R (http://www.quantpsy.org)
(Selig & Preacher, 2008). The results of other two methods are available
via online supplementary material. In addition, we also tested the model
with Monte-Carlo based MSEM in Mplus, which unfortunately does not
work due to a convergence problem.
4
This interaction effect became nonsignificant (B ⫽ .09, p ⫽ .14) when
all control variables were removed from the regression model. All other
findings remained unaffected with or without adding controls.

Prosocial Behavior

Sample, procedure, and measures. We sought to recruit 400
(100 per condition) participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
(MTurk) with inclusion requests that participants must be full-time
employees and possess qualifications that indicate high-quality
prior work at MTurk.5 We paid each participant $2.50 for participation in the experiment. We randomly assigned participants into
four conditions, in a fully crossed, 2 (higher vs. lower COVID19-triggered mortality salience) ⫻ 2 (higher vs. lower servant
leadership) between-individuals design. First, participants were
presented with a collection of current COVID-19 news, in which
COVID-19-triggered mortality salience was manipulated and were
then asked to rate their state anxiety. Next, they were instructed to
work on a task with a manager whose servant leadership was
manipulated (Wu, Liden, Liao, & Wayne, 2020; see Appendix C).
After that, they reported their job engagement and contributions to
communities facing hunger. Among the 345 participants who
completed the experiment, 35 failed to pass the attention checks,
and 28 spent an extremely short time (less than 4 min—the fastest
possible time for a participant to provide responses; e.g., Yuan et
al., 2019). The final sample consisted of 282 participants, leading
to a valid response rate of 81.7%. The participants held occupational positions such as project manager, business analyst, and
engineer across a variety of industries such as finance, technology,
health care, and retail. All participants were above 18 years old,
75.2% were between 25 and 44 years of age, 41.5% of them were
female, and the average job tenure was 6.59 years (SD ⫽ 5.43).
We measured state anxiety and job engagement using the same
items in Study 1 (1 ⫽ very slightly to 5 ⫽ extremely). Prosocial
behavior was measured by the amount of donation from their
payment of the study to Feeding America to support communities
facing hunger.

Results
Table 3 shows the basic statistics and correlations among focal

(B ⫽ .51, p ⬍ .001), supporting Hypothesis 1. The interaction term
(State Anxiety ⫻ Servant Leadership; Model 2) was positively
related to job engagement (B ⫽ .25, p ⫽ .03) and prosocial

We conducted Bayesian path-analysis instead of Bayesian SEM analysis in the two experiments (Study 2 and Study 3) for three reasons. First,
three of the five study variables in the model (i.e., COVID-19-triggered
mortality salience manipulation condition, servant leadership manipulation
condition, prosocial behavior) were each measured using a single item.
Second, the subject-to-parameter ratio in path-analysis was 17.63 (282:16)
in Study 2 and 13.13 (210:16) in Study 3, which were larger than that in
SEM (5.88 or 282:48 in Study 2 and 3.82 or 210:55 in Study 3) and closer
to the recommended ratio of 20 and an acceptable ratio of 10 suggested by
Jackson (2007) and Kline (2016). Third, the XWITHIN function to estimate interaction effects in Bayesian SEM does not allow producing deviance information criteria (DIC) value for model fit comparison (Cain &
Zhang, 2019). The Bayesian SEM analysis produces largely similar path
estimates as the Bayesian path-analysis via Mplus in the two studies. The
results are available via online supplementary material.

porting Hypothesis 3. In sum, Study 2 largely replicated our test of
the hypotheses and supported causal inferences. Yet it remains
unclear whether death-specific anxiety, a more proximal outcome
of thoughts of death, may serve the same role as general state
anxiety does in the relationship of COVID-19-triggered mortality
salience and employee responses. Thus, we conducted a new
experiment by replacing general anxiety with death anxiety.

Study 3
Method
Sample, procedure, and measures. We sought to recruit 280
(70 per condition) participants from MTurk7 following the same
procedure in Study 2. Among the 272 participants who completed
the experiment, we obtained 210 valid responses following the
same data scrutinization procedure as in Study 2, leading to a valid
response rate of 77.2%. Of the 210 participants, 34.3% were
female, 74.3% were between 25 and 44 years old, and the average
job tenure was 6.32 years (SD ⫽ 4.80). Participants held occupational positions such as engineer, sales manager, and business
analyst across a variety of industries such as finance, technology,
retail, and health care. We used the same manipulations and
measures as in Study 2. To measure state death anxiety, we used
a five-item scale from Belmi and Pfeffer (2016) (e.g., “I feel
worried about my death”; 1 ⫽ very slightly to 5 ⫽ extremely).
Manipulations check. The manipulations of COVID-19triggered mortality salience (Mhigh ⫽ 3.66, Mlow ⫽ 3.11, F(1,

Study 3.

Results
Table 5 shows the basic statistics and correlations among focal
variables. We conducted path analyses using Mplus 8.3 with a
Bayesian method. As shown in Model 1 of Table 6, COVID-19triggered mortality salience was positively related to state death
anxiety (B ⫽ 1.04, p ⬍ .001), supporting Hypothesis 1. The
interaction term (State Death Anxiety ⫻ Servant Leadership;
Model 2) was not related to job engagement (B ⫽ .00, p ⫽ .49),
rejecting Hypothesis 2. This interaction term was positively related
to prosocial behavior (B ⫽ .26, p ⫽ .004). As shown in Figure 6,

General Discussion
We conducted three studies with different research designs and
samples from both Eastern and Western cultures to test our model.
Our findings showed that COVID-19-triggered mortality salience
increases state anxiety (general anxiety in Study 1 and Study 2 and
death-specific anxiety in Study 3). The results apply TMT to the
unique context of COVID-19 and to understand employees’ emotional and behavioral responses in the face of salient mortality
cues. We show that when dealing with an unprecedented crisis like
COVID-19, mortality salience not only triggers anxiety about own
deaths (in Study 3) but also generates tremendous overall anxiety
(in Study 1 and Study 2). It is worth noting that in Study 1, we
found that the subjective thoughts of death, but not the objective
daily COVID-19 death cases, influenced employees’ anxiety.
These findings concur with terror management research findings
that only when individuals are aware of the inevitability of death,
do they generate unpleasant anxiety (Greenberg & Arndt, 2012).
We also contribute to the terror management research by highlighting the importance of servant leadership in translating state
anxiety resulting from mortality salience to job engagement and
prosocial behavior. TMT holds that when people espouse compassion and have increased feelings of self-worth, they are better able
to manage terror and mitigate harmful outcomes of anxiety
(Greenberg & Arndt, 2012). We found that servant leaders who
keep employees’ well-being paramount and model compassion can
help anxious employees stay engaged at work and help the broader
community. In Studies 1 and 2, we found that servant leadership
moderates the negative effect of COVID-19-triggered mortality
salience on job engagement via state anxiety. Interestingly, findings in Study 2 revealed that the relationship between state anxiety

and job engagement became positive when servant leadership was
higher. Study 3 also showed a positive main effect of death anxiety
on job engagement. A possible reason for these findings might be
that in the experimental context, participants completed the vignette tasks in a short time, not long enough for anxiety to cause
cognitive disruptions that jeopardize job engagement. Prior research also showed that terror management defensive actions (e.g.,
reduced efforts) do not occur immediately after mortality is primed
but become salient after a delay (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &
Solomon, 1999).
Our findings also provide timely, practical implications. First,
organizations have an imperative to act to help employees better
adjust to the outbreak and mitigate the negative influence on their
mental and emotional experiences. Second, organizations and
leaders should form a more balanced understanding of the importance of employees’ state anxiety in shaping their efforts at and

outside work. Specifically, our findings suggest that servant leaders can help employees find meaning during a crisis and encourage
them to engage at work and to volunteer more in the community.
We encourage organizations to train leaders to demonstrate servant
behaviors. For example, leaders can help employees take up the
challenge by spending more time connecting with their employees
even when they are physically distant and providing more autonomy for them to better transit to remote work.
Our research is subject to several limitations, which point to
future directions. COVID-19 is having a far-reaching impact on
our lives and livelihoods. We are unable to test employees’ adjustment in the postcrisis world, but it would be a significant
extension to the crisis management research to evaluate how
employees build resilience during and after the crisis (e.g., Williams & Shepherd, 2016). Second, we focus on job engagement to
measure employees’ investment in their work roles, but other
outcomes such as absenteeism (Sliter et al., 2014) also warrant
attention. Third, our findings deviate from Grant and WadeBenzoni’s (2009) perspective that death anxiety resulting from
mortality cues leads to work withdrawal while death reflection
leads to increased prosocial behavior. A possible explanation of
the differences might be that compared to other death-exposed
incidents, COVID-19 is a global tragedy that affects us all, and the
associated anxiety may motivate people to search for connection
and to pursue a higher path of humanity. Nevertheless, we are
unable to compare whether death anxiety and reflection would
differently influence workplace and community behaviors and
hope this limitation will be addressed in future studies.

Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As of April 13, 2020,
around the world, among the currently infected patients of
COVID-19, 96% (1,262, 011) are in mid condition, and
among the closed cases, 79% (422,556) have been recovered or discharged. Due to a lack of widespread testing,
many people who have recovered from coronavirus are not
included and the recovered cases may be more than reported.
• The respiratory disease at this point pales in comparison to
the seasonal flu. Patients with COVID-19 show flu-like
symptoms of fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people
recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Some people who are infected never got physically
sick themselves. A team of infectious disease experts
calculated the fatality rate of coronavirus outbreak is about
1.4%, drastically lower than earlier estimates.
• COVID-19 is more likely to affect the aged and those with
underlying conditions. But seeing reports the 102-year-old
woman from Italy and the 104-year-old veteran in Oregon
who both recovered from the illness has been inspiring.
• Without protective measures, one person on average infects 2.5 others. The good news is that transmission can
be prevented. Good personal hygiene and social distancing can be very effective. Due to high levels of selfquarantine, countries and regions have reported significantly fewer infections. There is no treatment for COVID19, but medical care can treat most of the symptoms.
Scientists have figured out how COVID-19 breaks into
human cells, which will help significantly in developing
treatments. Vaccination trials in several countries including the US are already underway. Researchers of the
Erasmus Medical Center have found an antibody against
COVID-19.9

Manipulation Materials of Mortality Salience
Higher mortality salience condition. Please read a summary
of news about the novel coronavirus from major news outlets:
• Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory
illness that can spread from person to person. The number
of COVID-19 cases in the United States keeps jumping
each day by over 20,000. By Monday, April 13, the
COVID-19 outbreak in the United States had grown to at
least 559, 712 cases and 22,070 deaths in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana
Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Around the world,
there are at least 1,849,381 cases and 114,053 deaths.8 But
due to a lack of widespread testing, the outbreak is likely
to be even bigger.
• The respiratory disease is deadly and akin to severe pneumonia. Patients with COVID-19 show symptoms of fever,
coughing, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia—anything
short of requiring oxygen. Severe cases require supplemental oxygen, sometimes via a breathing tube and a
ventilator. Critical cases involve “respiratory failure or
multi-organ failure,” severe illness and death. If people get
infected, they may change from no symptoms to difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or chest
pressure, an onset of confusion or the inability to stay
awake, and bluish lips or face in just two days. On
average, COVID-19 fatalities are happening “eight
days” after patients show first symptoms.
• No one—young and old, healthy and infirm—has immunity. Seeing reports the 30-year-old baseball coach in New
Jersey and the 25-year-old pharmacy tech in California
who both died from the illness and were not believed to
have had any underlying conditions has been unsettling.
• COVID-19 can spread about one to three days before
symptoms start. An intensive-care expert broke down just
how contagious the coronavirus is, showing how one
person could end up infecting 59,000 in a snowball
effect. Cases are spreading exponentially. Hospitals and
medical staff have quickly become overwhelmed. Know
that if you do go to the hospital, there is currently no
treatment for COVID-19.
Lower mortality salience condition. Please read a summary
of news about the novel coronavirus from major news outlets:
• Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory
illness that can spread from person to person. By Monday,
April 13, the recovered cases of COVID-19 in the United
States had grown to at least 32, 832 in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana

In Study 3, the information was updated with data current as of May
21, 2020. In the higher mortality salience condition, “By Thursday, May
21, the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States had grown to at least 1.61
million cases and 95, 213 deaths in all 50 states, the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico. Around the world, there are at least 5.11 million cases and
333,000 deaths.” In the lower mortality salience condition, “By Thursday,
May 21, the recovered cases of COVID-19 in the United States had grown
to at least 309,000 in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico. As of May 21, 2020, around the world, among the currently infected
patients of Covid-19, 98% (2,745,318) are in mid condition, and among the
closed cases, 86% (2,115,542) have been recovered or discharged.”

In Study 3, this sentence was changed to “Remdesivir is one of the
most promising therapies against Covid-19 as it was shown to attack the
virus once it is spreading inside the body” based on information current as
of May 21, 2020.

Manipulation Materials of Servant Leadership in
Study 2 and Study 3 Adapted From Wu et al., 2020
Higher servant leadership condition. Imagine you have
been working in a consulting company that helps solve problems
for small-to-medium-sized businesses. The team consists of the
team leader—Alex and three team members—you, Chris, and
Casey. Since you started in your position, you have experienced
the following in your work environment. The father of your
coworker, Casey, broke his arm and needed some extra help during
a few weeks of recovery. Your supervisor Alex allowed Casey to
work some flexible hours during that time. Since your team started
virtually during this pandemic, Alex has regularly checked in with
each of you to make sure that you are prepared both technically
and mentally to transit to virtual work.
Six months ago, a new project became available which you
knew would be a good career-related experience for you, but
you were on another project which better fit your current skills.
You asked Alex to be moved to the new project even though it
meant that you would be working more slowly until you learned
the new set of skills. You were happy, but not surprised when you
were allowed to move to the new project as that is commonly the
way such requests are handled on your team. Not long after you
started working on the new project, your team encountered an
unexpected challenge that threatened to delay the completion date.
Alex was quick to recognize that there was a problem with the
project even though your team had not yet fully understood the fact
that the project had encountered a major problem. Despite the
high-profile nature of the project, Alex showed confidence in the
team by empowering the team to find and implement your team’s
solution for the problem. Again, you were not surprised as this is
what your team has grown to expect from Alex. Twice during the
past few months, Alex has had the opportunity to meet short term
goals by making ethically questionable decisions. In both cases
Alex clearly refused to bend any ethical rules, setting a good
example for your team. In addition to your regular job, Alex
encourages each team member to spend time volunteering for
causes that give back to the community, even if those volunteer
opportunities are small or unrelated to official corporate programs.
Now your team just got a new client: Blake, owner of a consumer retail company that sells kitchen-wares, a small company
with 25 employees. In the past few months, Blake has witnessed a
noticeable drop in the revenue and wants to seek help for increasing profits. Alex wants each of you to first come up with some
ideas to help Blake. Please think about any potential ways to help
Blake to increase the retail company’s revenue. Please write down
3 to 5 possible suggestions in the box below.

Lower servant leadership condition. Imagine you have been
working in a consulting company that helps solve problems for
small-to-medium-sized businesses. The team consists of the team
leader—Alex and three team members—you, Chris, and Casey.
Since you started in your position, you have experienced the
following in your work environment. You have noticed that your
supervisor Alex is usually fair, but that decisions are made to
maximize how upper management views the productivity of the
team and, by extension, Alex. Sometimes this makes team members look less productive to upper management, but Alex does not
believe that personal or professional concern for team members
should get in the way of meeting group performance benchmarks.
Since your team started virtually during this pandemic, Alex has
never checked in with each of you to see if you are prepared both
technically and mentally to transit to virtual work.
Six months ago, a new project became available that you knew
would be a good career related experience for you, but you were
already on another project which better fit your current skills. You
asked Alex to be moved to the new project, but Alex kept you on
the old project because it would hurt the company if you worked
more slowly as you tried to learn the skills needed for the new
project. More recently, your team started to encounter a number of
work-related problems that threatened to seriously delay a delivery
deadline. Initially, Alex failed to recognize that something was
going wrong at work. Then, after you explained the problems and
suggested some solutions, Alex refused to let you handle the
situation in your own way, telling you what to do instead. As part
of the solution, Alex lied to the client about what your team was
delivering to them. Although this tactic did result in successfully
meeting the deadline, you believe that it did not adhere to the
ethics training that you regularly receive. In addition to your
regular job, you would like to spend time volunteering for causes
that give back to the community. However, Alex was not supportive and told you that those volunteer opportunities were small or
unrelated to official corporate programs.
Now your team just got a new client: Blake, owner of a consumer retail company that sells kitchen-wares, a small company
with 25 employees. In the past few months, Blake has witnessed a
noticeable drop in the revenue and wants to seek help for increasing profits. Alex wants each of you to first come up with some
