A focus on helping others is generally lauded, particularly in medicine, but in the context of a pandemic
when health care professionals are facing increased risk, loss, and trauma, this focus can potentially be
detrimental. In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the
coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial
impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data
collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the
relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional
exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived
prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during
COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes
collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional
exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental
analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with
emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial
impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the
frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

United States, of which at least 702 had died (CDC, 2020).
Globally, more than 450,000 health care workers are estimated to
have contracted the virus (Mantovani, 2020). Higher case numbers
and a growing list of victims are reported daily. While the physical
cost to health care workers is being quantified, more research is
needed on the psychological and emotional cost. Anecdotal evidence suggests that health care workers on the frontlines of the
pandemic are at increased risk for depression, suicide, and other
negative outcomes (e.g., Glenza, 2020; Hoffman, 2020; Watkins et
al., 2020). In this study, we sought to understand if this anecdotal
evidence was supported by quantitative research and, if so, to what
extent involvement with COVID-19 among health care workers is
associated with these negative outcomes. And, second, using doctors and nurses as an empirical referent in the context of a global
pandemic, we sought to understand if prosocial motivation and
perceived prosocial impact affect these relationships to explore
how a focus on helping others hurts and how it helps professionals
facing a crisis situation.
Following Bacharach and Bamberger (2007), who explored how
critical incident involvement in 9/11 by first responders influenced
negative emotional states, we examine critical incident involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and its association with
both emotional exhaustion at work and depression. Critical incidents are time-limited events that are often unexpected and potentially life-threatening (Flannery, 1999), and exposure to critical
incidents has been linked to depression, anxiety, and stress (Ver-

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of
September 12th, 2020, more than 28 million cases had been
confirmed worldwide, including over 911,000 fatalities, resulting
from the emergence of a new strain in the coronavirus family
called SARS-Cov-2 or, more commonly, coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19; World Health Organization, 2020). While individuals
all over the world are facing increased pressure and stress because
of lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing, massive job
loss, and the closure of schools and childcare centers (e.g., Orgilés
et al., 2020; Rajkumar, 2020), perhaps no profession has been
harder hit than health care; whose workers are on the frontlines of
the pandemic response. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), by September 12th, 2020, at least
159,300 health care personnel had contracted COVID-19 in the

CALDAS, OSTERMEIER, AND COOPER

metten & Bremner, 2002). To examine why critical incident involvement should relate to emotional exhaustion and depression,
we draw from ego depletion theory. According to ego depletion
theory (cf. Baumeister et al., 1998), when individuals modify the
way they think, feel, or behave to adapt to societal norms and
expectations, they draw from a limited pool of regulatory resources
(Muraven & Baumeister, 2000). If individuals draw from this pool
too much, this results in resource depletion that ultimately “renders
the self temporarily less able and less willing to function normally
or optimally” (Baumeister & Vohs, 2007, p. 2).
Recent research exploring how helping affects the well-being of
helpers finds that this relationship depends on whether helping
increases or depletes the helper’s resources (Bamberger et al.,
2017). We argue that a higher level of involvement in the
COVID-19 pandemic response is associated with resource depletion for health care workers, as they suppress their personal fears
while serving their patients. Health care workers must push aside
their concerns for themselves, their coworkers, and their family
members (who they may expose to the virus because of their work)
to do their job and provide the best care for their patients. This care
is provided in the context of a shortage of personal protective
equipment, or PPE (Orecchio-Egresitz et al., 2020), constantly
changing CDC guidelines (Kavanagh et al., 2020), a lack of
leadership at the federal level of government (McCarthy, 2020),
and with no end in sight to the pandemic (Hauser, 2020). This
resource depletion may ultimately lead to increased emotional
exhaustion—feelings of being overextended and exhausted by
emotional demands at work (Demerouti et al., 2001)—and greater
susceptibility to negative emotional states, such as depression.
To understand which health care workers may be most at risk
and to identify a potential mitigating factor of these negative
outcomes, we propose two factors that affect the extent of resource
depletion from involvement in the crisis. Research finds that
prosocially motivated individuals are more likely to become depleted from helping coworkers (Lanaj et al., 2016). We build on
this work and suggest that a crisis situation, particularly one
involving a direct threat to one’s self, is likely to cause more
depletion for prosocially motivated individuals who use psychological resources stifling personal concerns to push themselves to
help others. We argue, however, that while prosocial motivation
likely exacerbates the association between involvement in the
pandemic response and negative emotional and psychological outcomes, a potential replenishing factor also exists: perceived prosocial impact. Perceived prosocial impact, or the extent to which
individuals perceive that they are making a positive impact
through their work during the crisis, could mitigate the negative
association between critical incident involvement and both emotional exhaustion and depression. The belief that one is helping
others can help to replenish personal resources and reduce emotional exhaustion (Grant & Sonnentag, 2010) and could allow
more satisfaction from sacrifices, improving emotional well-being
(Glomb et al., 2011).
The ego depletion model has not been devoid of criticism, which
tends to fall in two broad categories (Baumeister, 2020): first,
those who offer alternate explanations for ego-depletion phenomena, and second, those who question the mere existence of egodepletion effects. In the former, some scholars have refuted the
limited-energy hypothesis and substitute it with more conventional
psychological categories, such as variations in motivation and

attention (e.g., Inzlicht & Schmeichel, 2012). In the second group,
theoretical and empirical analyses, commonly using replication
studies, have disputed resource depletion explanations for selfregulatory failures found in ego-depletion experiments, casting
doubts on the existence of a strong or even moderate ego-depletion
effect (e.g., Carter et al., 2015; Hagger et al., 2016). Ego depletion
theorists (e.g., Baumeister et al., 2018; Baumeister & Vohs, 2016)
have counterargued that replications such as Hagger et al.’s failed
in their design (e.g., they argue the manipulation failed to create
ego depletion), procedures (used an untested set of procedures and
did not operationalize core constructs), and could not invalidate
ego depletion as it would constitute a single study with null results
(Baumeister et al., 2018, p. 143). Given the volume of research on
ego depletion, these recent defenses, and its relevance to our
research questions, we utilize this theoretical lens.
Better understanding the negative emotional effects of individual involvement in crises, as well as the intensifying effects of
prosocial motivation, contribute to both theory and practice. Theoretically, such understanding extends existing theory on critical
incident involvement (Bacharach & Bamberger, 2007; Monnier et
al., 2002), ego depletion theory (e.g., Baumeister et al., 1998;
Muraven & Baumeister, 2000), and the “dark side” of prosocial
motivation (e.g., Bolino & Turnley, 2005; Lanaj et al., 2016). To
practice, such questions are relevant to devise protection and
coping strategies for professionals facing time-limited crises, including— but not limited to—pandemics and health care emergencies.

Critical Incident Involvement, Emotional Exhaustion,
and Depression
Critical incidents are traumatic time-limited events that are
faced by individuals in the course of doing their jobs (Monnier et
al., 2002). These events, conceptualized as severe job-related stressors, affect those involved at the time and, potentially, even years
after the critical incident has passed (Bacharach & Bamberger,
2007; Monnier et al., 2002). Intensity of involvement in a critical
incident captures the extent of exposure to different sources of
trauma within the event, such as observing injury to others and
being exposed to direct personal harm. Because of the nature of
these events, individuals are forced to utilize psychological resources to cognitively process the event and generate a new mental
model to restore feelings of invulnerability and security (Bacharach & Bamberger, 2007; Nishith et al., 2001).
Critical incident involvement is particularly problematic in the
health care industry, as exposure to a traumatic event (such as the
response to the COVID-19 pandemic) could exacerbate the already
intense job demands of doctors and nurses (cf. Broetje et al., 2020)
for those who are intensely involved. Intense job demands deplete
psychological resources and breed emotional exhaustion (Demerouti et al., 2001; Hobfoll, 2002). When individuals view their tasks
negatively, they are more likely to focus on undesirable aspects of
their job, which both consumes psychological resources and reduces energy levels (Grant & Sonnentag, 2010). This makes it
more exhausting for individuals to devote time and effort in their
work (Fritz & Sonnentag, 2006). Additionally, affect regulation, in
which individuals are required to suppress emotions, drains personal resources, fostering fatigue and focusing attention on feelings of fatigue (Baumeister, 2014; Baumeister et al., 1998). Cou-

WHEN HELPING HURTS

pled with intense job demands, involvement in the pandemic is
likely to consume psychological resources as individuals manage
their own negative emotions, including fears of contagion, support
fearful and grieving patients and their family members, and adjust
to new frustrations in doing their work such as wearing cumbersome protective equipment (without the certainty it may fully
protect them).

Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of critical incident involvement
are associated with increased emotional exhaustion.
Emotional exhaustion at work is a core feature of burnout and
results from work-related stress, whereas depression is more diffuse across life domains and is characterized by loss of interest,
feelings of worthlessness, and impaired concentration (Bianchi et
al., 2015; Maslach et al., 2001). In other words, emotional exhaustion and depression differ regarding their contextual specificity—
the former is centered on the individual’s social and organizational
work context and the latter is more global and reflects general
personal feelings and beliefs (Leiter & Durup, 1994). While there
is debate about whether job burnout (and, therefore, emotional
exhaustion) is distinct from depression (cf. Bianchi et al., 2015),
the two constructs have been found to be empirically distinct (e.g.,
Bakker et al., 2000; Glass & McKnight, 1996; Iacovides et al.,
2003).
We theorize that critical incident involvement is also correlated
with increased depression. It has been found that as negative life
events lead to resource loss, they can foster symptoms of depression (Holahan et al., 1999). Individuals with intense or sustained
job demands may become depressed as they are unable to replenish their personal resources and lack energy for other life activities.
Prior work has found that job demands can increase depression
(Ahola & Hakanen, 2007; Bakker et al., 2000), including among
health care workers (Baba et al., 1999). Individuals who are
intensely involved in the pandemic may also lack the resources
needed to effectively process the trauma they have experienced at
work, leading to increased depression (Baumeister et al., 1999).
Hypothesis 2: Higher levels of critical incident involvement is
associated with increased depression.

The Intensifying Effect of Prosocial Motivation
Monnier and colleagues (2002) argued that individuals differ in
the resource loss they experience resulting from critical incidents
and that individuals who experience greater resource losses suffer
greater negative psychological outcomes. We propose that prosocial motivation is an important individual difference that is related
to how individuals are affected by involvement in a critical incident. Prosocial motivation refers to performing work based on “the
desire to benefit others or expend effort out of concern for others”
(Bolino & Grant, 2016, p. 4), and following others, we conceptualize it as a stable tendency regarding a concern for others (Bolino
& Grant, 2016).
In general, evidence suggests that having prosocial employees is beneficial to organizations as these individuals tend to be
motivated to contribute (Kim et al., 2013; Lester et al., 2008;
Miles et al., 1989). While organizations benefit from these contributions, the effects of helping on individuals’ well-being varies (Bamberger et al., 2017). Individuals who are motivated by prosocial

31

motivation are driven to act according to their values, relying on
conscious self-regulation to accomplish their tasks, and tend to focus
their attention on the outcomes of their work (Grant, 2008a). When
helping feels volitional and achieves helping goals, prosocially motivated individuals improve their well-being through helping, which
increases their feelings of competence and relatedness to others
(Weinstein & Ryan, 2010). However, when prosocial motivation is
based on pressure and when the benefits of helping are less visible, it
can drain personal resources and lead to negative emotional outcomes
(Bamberger et al., 2017; Gebauer et al., 2008).
We argue that rather than benefiting health care workers
dealing with COVID-19, higher prosocial motivation will actually serve to exacerbate the relationship between intensity of
involvement and experienced emotional exhaustion and depression, as highly prosocial doctors and nurses will use more
regulatory resources managing their responses to the crisis.
Because of the lack of treatment options, the crisis has reduced
the ability to improve patients’ health and achieve helping
goals. It also poses a direct threat to health care workers’
personal safety. Rather than feeling natural and voluntary,
attempting to help patients requires health care workers to push
past their own fears of exposure to themselves (and indirectly,
their families). In the face of these risks, prosocial individuals
will put internal pressure on themselves to prioritize others,
relying on self-control and taxing their personal resources to
provide help (Lanaj et al., 2016). Prosocial individuals are also
more likely to risk negative outcomes to themselves to help
others (Graziano et al., 2007), suggesting that prosocial individuals may put themselves into riskier and more emotionally
demanding situations with patients. These actions foster resource depletion, which may lead to emotional exhaustion and
depression.
This theorizing is aligned with recent research on the dark
side of prosocial motivation, which posits that whereas prosocial motivation may be beneficial for organizations, it may not
always be beneficial for the individuals themselves. For example, research has found that highly prosocial individuals may
take on too much work, leading to stress, work overload, and
reduced performance (Bergeron, 2007; Bolino & Turnley, 2005;
Kibler et al., 2019). Highly prosocial employees are also susceptible to “white knight syndrome,” where they rush to rescue
and offer help that is not wanted or needed (Oakley et al.,
2011). Because highly prosocial individuals are more likely to
respond to the crisis by putting internal pressure on themselves
to help more and to try to suppress concerns about the personal
risks, the crisis is likely to take a greater toll on their personal
resources and have a stronger association with emotional exhaustion and depression for these individuals.
Hypothesis 3: Prosocial motivation moderates the relationship
between critical incident involvement and emotional exhaustion such that this relationship is stronger when prosocial
motivation is higher.
Hypothesis 4: Prosocial motivation moderates the relationship
between critical incident involvement and depression such
that this relationship is stronger when prosocial motivation is
higher.

The Mitigating Effect of Perceived Prosocial Impact
While prosocial motivation refers to the desire to benefit others,
perceived prosocial impact is defined as the experience of making
a positive difference in the lives of others through one’s work
(Bolino & Grant, 2016). While having higher prosocial motivation
illustrates how a focus on helping can hurt, we theorize that having
higher perceived prosocial impact can mitigate these effects and
provide some protection for health care workers against these
negative outcomes. As Grant and Sonnentag (2010, p. 13) found,
“doing good buffers against feeling bad.” Grant and Sonnentag
(2010) found that perceived prosocial impact buffered against the
costs of emotional exhaustion, as the experience of helping others
allowed employees to focus their attention on how their work led
to positive outcomes for others, rather than spending time dwelling
on the negative aspects of their work.
Similarly, perceived prosocial impact should allow health care
workers to focus their attention on how their work has had a
positive impact on their patients. When health care workers believe
they positively impact others, they should be better able to replenish regulatory resources because of the positive emotions and
self-affirmation (Schmeichel & Vohs, 2009; Tice et al., 2007)
associated with having helped others (Glomb et al., 2011). Consequently, perceived prosocial impact should help to mitigate the
association between involvement in the crisis and both exhaustion
and depression for frontline health care workers. Therefore, we
predict:
Hypothesis 5: Prosocial impact moderates the relationship
between critical incident involvement and emotional exhaustion such that this relationship is weaker when prosocial
impact is higher.
Hypothesis 6: Prosocial impact moderates the relationship
between critical incident involvement and depression such
that this relationship is weaker when prosocial impact is
higher.

A visual representation of our model and hypotheses is found in
Figure 1.

Method
Participants and Procedure
We distributed an online survey to currently working health care
professionals who were either enrolled in a health care MBA
program in the southwestern United States or recruited by students
of such program (IRB #2020 – 0426, “COVID-19 and Health Care
Workers”). Data was collected across three time points to minimize issues with common method bias (cf. Podsakoff et al., 2003).
Prosocial motivation and control variables were collected prepandemic. However, given the nature and time sensitivity of doing
COVID-19 research, variables related to the pandemic experience,
specifically involvement, perceived prosocial impact, and the outcome variables were collected at Time 3 (T3). Although such
design may raise concerns about common method bias and some
of the causal inferences, design techniques were used to reduce
such risks, and furthermore, it is known that interaction effects are
not biased by common method variance (Siemsen et al., 2010).
Data was collected from two cohorts of MDs and RNs, and each
cohort participated in three waves of data collection. The first
cohort (67.8% of the sample) completed Time 1 (T1) and Time 2
(T2) in February 2019; the second (32.2% of the sample) completed T1 and T2 between late January and early February 2020.
T1 and T2 were collected 2 weeks apart for both cohorts. T3 was
completed by all respondents between April 28th and May 8th,
2020. The data collected during T1 and T2 were developed as part
of a different study; however, because of the pandemic, we decided to collect more data from such respondents, to explore the
effects of COVID-19. All individuals who either participated or
recruited participants in the T1 and T2 data collection were contacted about the opportunity to participate in T3 to explore the

effects of COVID-19 on health care workers. Of the 274 doctors
and nurses who had participated, 172 (62.8%) were located and
agreed to participate in T3, and 126 participants followed through.
Of the 126, 118 were currently working and these responses were
used in the analysis (N ⫽ 118). Demographic data for these

Tables 3 and 4 display the scale information for all of the
variables examined in this study (with the exception of the intensity of involvement scale and the control variables) and the descriptive statistics and correlations.

Intensity of Involvement in Pandemic Response
We adapted Monnier and colleagues’ (Monnier et al., 2002)
“Critical Incident Inventory” or CII, following Bacharach and
Bamberger’s (2007) adaptation to 9/11 involvement. Our adaptation of the CII to the COVID-19 pandemic response includes 19
total items across six subdimensions. Following Bacharach and
Bamberger (2007), our CII adaptation required respondents to
focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and respond with it as their
frame of reference. In line with both Bacharach and Bamberger
(2007) and Monnier et al. (2002), we generated a total score for the
intensity of involvement in the pandemic response by summing the
item-specific scores. Respondents noted whether they had experienced (“1”) or not experienced (“0”) the particular situation during
the pandemic (at the time data was collected, this meant 2 to 3
weeks to most respondents, according to information gathered
during recruitment). The response options mirrored the dichotomous design of the original scale, and the five items in the “trauma
to self” category were scored higher (from 2–5), following Bacharach and Bamberger (2007), because of the different order of
magnitude for these items. The potential total measure score
ranged from 0 –30, with the mean response score of 5.71 (actual
range of total scores was 0 –20). Our adaptation of CII to
COVID-19 can be seen in the Appendix and was collected in T3.
Table 5 highlights the breakdown of the “experienced” versus “not
experienced” response per item for our sample.

depression (Riolo et al., 2005), tenure, which has been show to
relate to exhaustion for health care workers (Kelly et al., 2015),
profession (doctor or nurse), because these professions can differ
in levels of emotional exhaustion (Sorenson et al., 2016), and
workload increases, which could increase the burden of the crisis.
Second, following Becker (2005), we retained the controls that
correlated with at least one of our dependent variables, specifically
profession (doctor or nurse), age, and increased workload (see
Table 4 for correlations). We included these three variables as
controls in all models. We also controlled for the year in which the
participant participated in T1 and T2 (2019 or 2020).

2) but not Hypothesis 4. For emotional exhaustion, when prosocial
motivation was lower (3.88), the effect ⫽ ⫺.008, ns, and when
prosocial motivation was higher (5.00), the effect ⫽ .07 (p ⬍ .001;
95% CI [.036, .100]). Perceived prosocial impact did not significantly moderate the relationships between involvement and emotional exhaustion (B ⫽ .001, ns) or depression (B ⫽ .01, ns), and
hence Hypotheses 5 and 6 were not supported.

Supplemental Analyses and Results
We conducted a number of additional analyses to further explore these variables and relationships (see Tables 7–13). These
analyses extend our primary analysis by exploring potential threeway interactions among the main variables, examining how incident involvement affected perceptions of impact, deepening our
understanding of the critical incident scale and its effects, and
providing additional checks on the robustness of our findings.

Three-Way Interactions
In the first supplemental analysis, we examined potential threeway interactions among intensity of involvement, prosocial motivation, and prosocial impact on both our outcome variables (see
Table 7). While we did not find that prosocial impact moderated
the relationship between involvement and outcomes, we considered it plausible that prosocial impact may be particularly important for prosocial individuals, given their desire to benefit others.
Specifically, with lower perceived prosocial impact, prosocial individuals may be even more depleted. The three-way interaction
among involvement, prosocial motivation, and prosocial impact
was not related to emotional exhaustion (B ⫽ ⫺.05, ns) but did

relate to depression (B ⫽ ⫺.04, p ⬍ .05; 95% CI [⫺.076, ⫺.002],
see Figure 3). Specifically, the effects on depression were as
follows for higher/lower prosocial motivation (5.00/3.88) and
higher/lower prosocial impact (4.84/3.71): higher prosocial motivation, lower prosocial impact (effect ⫽ .03, ns), higher prosocial
motivation, higher prosocial impact (effect ⫽ .02, ns), lower
prosocial motivation, lower prosocial impact (effect ⫽ ⫺.03, p ⬍
.05; 95% CI [⫺.064, ⫺.002]), lower prosocial motivation, higher
prosocial impact (effect ⫽ .01, ns).

Involvement, Prosocial Impact, and Perceived Social
Worth
The above analysis suggests that perceived prosocial impact
may influence responses to crisis involvement. To better understand how the pandemic is affecting these perceptions, we evaluated the effect of intensity of involvement on perceived prosocial
impact (see Table 8). Controlling for levels of prosocial impact as
reported in T2 as a baseline, we examined how intensity of
involvement related to prosocial impact in T3. The effect of
involvement on perceived prosocial impact in T3 was insignificant
(B ⫽ ⫺.002, ns). While involvement did not increase individuals’
own sense of impact, we explored if it related to how participants
felt others perceived their contributions. Perception of social
worth, or how much individuals believe their work is appreciated
by others, is a related relational benefit of helping (Grant, 2008b).
Intensity of involvement did not significantly relate to perceived
social worth in T3 within a 95% CI (B ⫽ ⫺.02, ns), see Table 8.

Subdimensions of the CII Scale
Because our CII scale was significantly adapted to this context,
we conducted an exploratory factor analysis to better understand
its factor structure. Factors loaded similarly to the dimensions
originally identified by Monnier and colleagues (2002) (see Table
9). In the main analysis we followed the precedent of Bacharach
and Bamberger (2007) and used the full scale to examine the
overall effect of being involved in the crisis. To identify which
aspects of the crisis experience were influencing outcomes, we
also examined how these subdimensions (with each event coded as
not experienced ⫽ 0 and experienced ⫽ 1), related to our two
outcome variables. Of the subdimensions identified in Table 9,
exposure to self significantly related to emotional exhaustion (B ⫽
.09, p ⬍ .05; 95% CI [.002, .173]) and depression (B ⫽ .08, p ⬍
.01; 95% CI [.030, .123]; see Table 10).

Additional Analyses Checks
We performed three additional checks on our findings. First, we
examined if the year in which the T1/T2 data was collected (2019

a similar pattern of hypothesis support as the main analysis.
Intensity of involvement in the pandemic positively related to
emotional exhaustion (B ⫽ .04, p ⬍ .01; 95% CI [.013, .063]) but
not depression (B ⫽ ⫺.002, ns). Prosocial motivation significantly
moderated the relationship between involvement and emotional
exhaustion (B ⫽ .05, p ⬍ .05; 95% CI [.004, .095]) but not
between involvement and depression (B ⫽ .01, ns). For emotional
exhaustion, when prosocial motivation was lower (3.88), the effect ⫽ ⫺.001, ns, and when prosocial motivation was higher
(5.00), the effect ⫽ .05 (p ⬍ .001; 95% CI [.026, .084]). Perceived
prosocial impact did not significantly moderate the relationships
between involvement and emotional exhaustion (B ⫽ ⫺.01, ns) or
depression (B ⫽ .01, ns; see Table 12).
Third, given the attrition between T1 and T3, we examined the
relationships while controlling for selection bias at T3 using inverse probability weighting (IPW; Thoemmes & Ong, 2016). We

conducted a logistic regression with participation in our T3 survey
(yes ⫽ 0/no ⫽ 1) as the dependent variable (e.g., Lang & Kell,
2020) and prosocial motivation, age, gender, doctor/nurse, ethnicity, and tenure in T1 as the independent variables. We used the
logistic regression results to create propensity scores and calculated weights using the inverse of these scores (1/PS). We included
these weights in our regression analyses, removing differences
between the follow-up T3 sample and the full sample regarding
these demographic attributes and prosocial motivation in T1. The
pattern of significance for hypothesized relationships did not differ
from the primary analysis (see Table 13).

the COVID-19 pandemic is critical and timely. Moreover, while
the majority of research on prosocial motivation has highlighted its
benefits, we demonstrate how prosocial motivation may intensify
the detrimental effects of a crisis. Focusing on the potential dark
side of prosocial motivation is important because individuals have
limited regulatory resources and, in some cases, prosocial motivation can lead to greater resource depletion and subsequently increase the risk of negative outcomes. Through our survey completed by doctors and nurses at two time points before the
COVID-19 pandemic and one time point during the pandemic,
consistent with our expectations, we found that (a) intensity of
involvement is associated with higher emotional exhaustion at
work and (b) prosocial motivation exacerbated the positive relationship between intensity of involvement and emotional exhaustion at work. Supplemental analyses suggested that the exposure to
self-subdimension of involvement associated with higher exhaustion and depression. Our findings offer several important implications for theory and practice on prosocial motivation, emotional
exhaustion, and depression in the context of involvement in an
intense crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Theoretical Contributions
Our central contributions lie in exploring (a) the ramifications of
intense involvement in a crisis for frontline health care workers,
through the COVID-19 response, and (b) how helping related
factors can exacerbate or mitigate the relationship of involvement
with negative psychological and emotional outcomes. Prior work
has established that health care workers are at risk for “compassion
fatigue,” an exhaustion that develops from caring for others experiencing trauma, and has differentiated it from the direct experience of trauma to oneself (Figley, 2002). Health care workers
intensely involved in the COVID-19 pandemic are facing both the
indirect trauma experienced by patients and their families, as well
as the direct threat of personal harm from the virus itself. Indeed,

our supplementary analysis suggests that the threat of exposure is
a key driver of negative emotional outcomes. Given this dual
threat, the COVID crisis is creating an intense strain on health care
workers’ ability to regulate their personal resources as they seek to
manage their own fears while providing care to others, putting
them at risk for emotional exhaustion and depression.
Building on prior work on prosocial motivation and the risk of
depletion (Lanaj et al., 2016) and contributing to our understanding of the dark side of prosocial motivation (Bolino & Grant,
2016), we explain why prosocial individuals are particularly vulnerable during this crisis. Specifically, we demonstrate how intense job demands and impediments to successful outcomes for
beneficiaries may take a stronger toll on individuals with higher
prosocial motivation. These individuals are likely to take on more
work and enter more risky situations as they attempt to achieve
their helping goals, and they are likely to expend more resources
managing their emotions when these goals are difficult to reach.
While we focus on health care workers, this phenomenon may also
occur in other fields in which prosocial individuals may encounter
extreme obstacles to their ability to achieve their goals to help
others, such as in social work, education, and in nonprofit organizations.
In crisis situations, it can be difficult to experience positive
outcomes of one’s work. With the United States death toll over
192,300 on September 12, 2020 and rising (CDC, 2020), many
health care workers are facing the loss of patients despite their best
efforts. Despite the role they played in the pandemic response, our
supplemental analysis suggests that intensity of involvement did
not increase health care workers’ sense of impact or how much
workers felt valued for their work. In this study, perceived prosocial impact did not significantly correlate with whether individuals
were doctors or nurses, their type of facility (hospital vs. clinic),
whether they worked for a profit or nonprofit organization, job
tenure, or whether their workload was affected by the crisis. This

suggests that perceived prosocial impact may be more locally
influenced by specific job design features and work contexts
(Grant, 2007) and varies within occupation. Even those in helpingoriented professions serving in a once-in-a-century crisis may need
support to see that they are making a positive difference in the
lives of others. Furthermore, the supplemental three-way interaction for depression was suggestive that prosocial impact may have
a different influence on responses to crisis involvement for individuals with different levels of prosocial motivation. Future research could further explore these dynamics to better understand
the interplay of these two factors, particularly in situations when
impact may associate with personal risk.
Our adaptation of the classical CII scale (Bacharach & Bamberger, 2007; Monnier et al., 2002) to the COVID-19 pandemic
can also be useful to future research on problematic and traumatic
events in the health care industry. The exploratory factor analysis
indicated that our 19-item adapted CII scale loaded similarly to the
six subdimensions identified by Monnier and colleagues (2002).
This adapted scale could be utilized in future studies as a measure
of health care workers’ exposure to crises, traumatic events, or
infectious diseases in general. Our adapted CII scale followed the
dichotomous design of the original scale, with respondents indicating whether they had experienced (“1”) or not experienced
(“0”) the particular situation. This approach is appropriate in
shorter or more recent events; however, if a crisis extends over a
longer time period, individuals may experience multiple exposures. Hence, for future studies of extended crises with potential
for recurring traumas, the CII scale could be further adapted to
capture the frequency of exposures.

Practical Implications
Our research offers meaningful insights for health care organizations and health care workers. First, as our model highlights,
when a health care worker is intensively involved in the response
to COVID-19 —that can include exposure to infected materials,
risk of infection to self, and the loss of multiple patients per
shift—they will experience negative outcomes. Realistically, experiencing some negative outcomes is unavoidable given the magnitude of the pandemic. These negative outcomes experienced by
health care workers are highlighted by some qualitative comments
provided by our respondents:
This crisis has caused stress to my colleagues to the point where we
lost five nurses in 2 weeks. Morale is low and our patients are easily
angered and have become verbally/physically aggressive.
[I go] to work not knowing what to expect. Always scared about
COVID-19.
PPE access is intermittent and always seems to downplay our exposure risk . . . Management and leadership are not understanding of the
stress caused by being at the bedside daily with these patients.

Thus, the question shifts from how can we prevent these negative outcomes to how can we mitigate them? First, by recognizing
who is most at risk—specifically, health care workers with higher
prosocial motivation, those clearly driven to do their work by their
concern for others. Second, given that fear of exposure is an
important factor in negative emotional outcomes, medical organizations need to ensure that substantial resources are invested into

equipment and training to support worker safety. While access to
PPE has proven challenging (Orecchio-Egresitz et al., 2020), acquiring and providing masks to their frontline health care workers
should be a top priority of health care organizations, even if it
means continuing to postpone more lucrative elective procedures.
Additionally, health care organizations should consider investing
significant capital into new rapid testing approaches (e.g., Wu,
2020) to facilitate testing with high frequency. Increasing the
availability of testing and providing a quick turn-around time
should help mitigate these fears of exposure.
Finally, given our findings that intensity of involvement in the
pandemic response is associated with increased emotional exhaustion, it is important that health care workers have opportunities to
recover from these draining experiences. Even though there are
shortages of some health care professionals (Spetz, 2020), it is
important to not overschedule health care workers and to allow
recovery days, especially after traumatic shifts, or this will lead to
resource depletion and, in the long run, exacerbate shortages.
During crises, interventions may also be needed to enrich health
care workers’ perceptions of prosocial impact and social worth,
which have been show to relate to positive outcomes (Grant,
2008b; Grant & Sonnentag, 2010). Health care organizations
should strive to communicate to their employees how their work,
no matter how small, is making a positive impact on patients—
especially in situations where hospitalization numbers and the
death toll are high. In fact, one documented intervention to help
manage job burnout included an intervention centered on the
meaning of work (de Oliveira et al., 2019). Other examples of how
organizations can communicate the importance of work to their
employees includes formal recognition by the organization for
their service and changes to pay and time off (e.g., hazard pay) to

recognize the importance of the work provided by frontline health
care professionals.
While these implications are specific to crises and are illustrated
by the COVID-19 context, there are several takeaways for other
organizations and nonpandemic contexts. Namely, this work draws
attention to the need to support prosocial individuals when the
context limits their ability to achieve helping goals, which converges with efforts in health care education and training to balance
“detached concern” with empathy (Halpern, 2001). Additionally,
these findings provide evidence that interventions are needed to
bolster employee mental health in occupations in which individuals risk personal harm.

Limitations and Future Directions
Despite the strengths of our study (temporal separation of measures, ability to compare pre-COVID and COVID data with frontline health care workers), there are some limitations to our study
that can be leveraged to create opportunities for future research.
First, because of the length of time between the pre-COVID time
points (for the majority of respondents) and the COVID time
period, recruiting enough respondents to have appropriate statistical power to detect significance effect sizes was challenging.
While a post hoc analysis indicated that our sample size was
appropriate to detect medium effect sizes with statistical power
above 0.80, indicating a low likelihood of making a Type II error
(cf. Cohen, 1992; Cohen et al., 2013; Hair et al., 2010), we were
precluded from some analyses. Specifically, because of sample
size limitations (cf. Marsh et al., 1988) and the use of previously
validated scales, we did not conduct a confirmatory factor analysis.
Second, data on intensity of involvement, emotional exhaustion,

and depression were provided by the same source at the same time,
raising concerns of common method bias and about some of the
causal inferences. However, a few key elements may mitigate such
risks. First, recent studies (e.g., Siemsen et al., 2010) have shown
that interaction effects are not biased by common method variance.
Second, methods were taken a priori to reduce these risks through
design techniques, such as protecting respondent anonymity to
reduce overinflation of the self-reports (Podsakoff et al., 2003).
Third, we did not collect data on other individual differences
beyond prosocial motivation and were unable to control for the
effects of underlying predispositions such as negative affectivity (Watson & Clark, 1984), which would make individuals
more susceptible to negative psychological outcomes such as
depression (Watson et al., 1988). Similarly, prosocial motivation could be masking for other individual differences that also
predict helping, such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and

positive affectivity (Podsakoff et al., 2000). Fourth, while we
argue that prosocial motivation can be detrimental to health
care workers because of their unrealized helping goals and
increased resource depletion, we do not have data on helping
behaviors. However, prosocial motivation correlated with increased workload during the pandemic, which is suggestive that
prosocially motivated health care workers volunteered for more
work during the crisis period. Additionally, these arguments are
consistent with prior theory and findings on resource depletion
and the dark side of prosocial motivation (Kibler et al., 2019;
Lanaj et al., 2016).
Fifth, because we only collected our emotional exhaustion and
depression scales in T3, we could not control for the effects of
these variables pre-COVID and some of our respondents may have
already been experiencing both emotional exhaustion and depression. According to the kindling hypothesis (Mcfarlane, 1998),

preexisting levels of depression (and arguably emotional exhaustion) pre-COVID would have exacerbated the effects of involvement in the pandemic response. Our sixth and last limitation has to
do with the dichotomous nature of the CII measure, which captured the intensity of the involvement in the pandemic response.

Specifically, this approach reduces its sensitivity in a prolonged
incident such as the response to COVID-19, as individuals who
noted that they have experienced a certain event likely might have
experienced it several times. However, this limitation is also a
strength of our research. As the kindling hypothesis suggests,

individuals do not normalize to repeat events; rather, these events
serve as “kindling” for subsequent distress at a higher level of
severity. Consequently, this suggests that our effect sizes are likely
to be conservative or downwardly biased.
Despite the potential limitations discussed previously, we believe that our initial findings can be built upon in future research,
which could test our model with other critical incidents and in
other high stress occupations. Additionally, future research should
explore the effects of critical incident involvement after the pandemic is over, to test whether the effects of the involvement linger
and contribute to negative mental health outcomes. Researchers
should investigate how individual differences (e.g., compassion,
conscientiousness, trait resilience, or negative affectivity) influence the effect of intensity of involvement on outcomes involving
health care workers and other essential workers. Lastly, researchers should explore cross-level models and the effects of unit
climates on resource depletion.

Conclusion
Overall, the findings highlighted above are consistent with our
theory of resource depletion, indicating that involvement in critical
incidents—such as the COVID-19 pandemic—associates with
higher emotional exhaustion. Wanting to help can hurt; higher
prosocial motivation exacerbated the positive relationship between
intensity of involvement in the pandemic response and emotional
exhaustion. Furthermore, concerns about personal harm during
critical incidents—in this case, exposure to the virus— can associate with higher levels of exhaustion and depression. The insights
provided on the nuances of prosocial motivation in the context of
resource depletion in critical incidents advance both theory and
practice.
