Covid-19 Infection Externalities: Trading Off Lives vs. Livelihoods

JEL No. E1,E65,H12,H23,I18
ABSTRACT
We analyze the externalities that arise when social and economic interactions transmit infectious
diseases such as COVID-19. Individually rational agents do not internalize that they impose
infection externalities upon others when the disease is transmitted. In an SIR model calibrated to
capture the main features of COVID-19 in the US economy, we show that private agents perceive
the cost an additional infection to be around $80k whereas the social cost including infection
externalities is more than three times higher, around $286k. This misvaluation has stark
implications for how society ultimately overcomes the disease: for a population of individually
rational agents, the precautionary behavior by the susceptible flattens the curve of infections, but
the disease is not overcome until herd immunity is acquired. The resulting economic cost is high;
an initial sharp decline in aggregate output followed by a slow recovery over several years. By
contrast, the socially optimal approach in our model focuses public policy measures on the
infected in order to contain the disease and quickly eradicate it, which produces a much milder
recession. If targeting the infected is impossible, the optimal policy in our model is still to
aggressively contain and eliminate the disease, and the social cost of an extra infection rises to
$586k.

Introduction

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has presented policymakers with a pivotal challenge: to choose between either an uncontrolled spread of the virus,
that may cost millions of lives in worst-case scenarios, or the imposition of
non-pharmaceutical public health interventions, such as social distancing that
harm economic and social activity and may undermine the livelihoods of far
larger numbers of people. Containing epidemics falls into the realm of public
policy because infectious diseases by their very nature involve externalities:
when infected individuals engage in social or economic activity, they impose
signicant externalities on those with whom they interact and whom they put
at risk of infection. The objective of this paper is to characterize the infection
externalities of COVID-19 and compare individually rational behavior with
what is socially optimal.
The novel coronavirus was rst identied in Wuhan, China, in December
2019. It jumped from bats via an intermediate host (likely pangolins traded in
live animal markets) to humans. The virus has ocially been named SARSCoV-2, and the disease that it causes has been named coronavirus disease
2019 (abbreviated COVID-19).

It spreads among humans via respiratory

droplets and aerosols as well as by touching infected surfaces. In an uncontrolled outbreak, the disease burden grows exponentially, with cases doubling
approximately every six days. The incubation period, i.e. the time between
when one is exposed to the virus and when one develops symptoms of disease,
is from two to 14 days, with an average of ve days. Those infected usually
present with a fever, a dry cough and general fatigue, frequently involving
a mild form of pneumonia.

About 15 percent of cases develop more severe

pneumonia that requires hospitalization, intensive care, and in many cases,
mechanical ventilation.

Verity et al. (2020) estimate the case fatality rate

to be around 0.67%  as long as the healthcare capacity of a country is not
overwhelmed.
This paper analyzes the externalities that arise when economic interactions
transmit infectious diseases such as COVID-19. We embed rationally optimi-

2

zing individual agents into epidemiological models to study and quantify the
trade-o between economic costs and epidemiological control. We start out by
building on the simplest epidemiological model, the SIS model, which splits
the population into two compartments  susceptible

S

and infected

I

 and

assumes that susceptible agents can acquire an infection by interacting with

infected agents at a given rate.

Infected agents

in turn recover at a given
In section 2 we embed op-

timizing individual agents into this model who choose the level of an economic
activity that may transmit infections and analyze the externalities arising from
individual choices. In section 3 we include an epidemiological compartment

R

of recovered & resistant agents in our analysis, delivering the SIR model in the
spirit of the epidemiological model rst laid out by Kermack and McKendrick
(1927).
We start by analyzing a model economy in which we introduce a disease
that imposes a utility cost on infected agents and that follows the dynamics
of an SIS model. We contrast the behavior of individually rational optimizing
agents with what would be chosen by a social planner who has the power
to coordinate the decisions of individual agents.

Individual agents who are

susceptible to a disease rationally reduce the level of their economic activity so
as to reduce the risk of infection. However, individually rational infected agents
recognize that they have nothing to lose from further social interaction and do
not internalize that their economic activities impose externalities upon others
by exposing them to the risk of infection. We show in a proposition that this
induces the social planner to value the cost of an extra infection more highly
than decentralized agents.

The decentralized SIS economy converges to an

equilibrium in which the disease is endemic. By contrast, a social planner who
internalizes the infection externalities induces infected agents to signicantly
reduce their economic activity so as to lower the spread of the disease.

In

our simulations, we nd that for a wide range of parameter values, the social

Anderson and May (1991) for a comprehensive textbook treatment of models of
epidemiology. A good overview is also available at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology

planner does this to a sucient extent to contain and eradicate the disease
from the population. Only if the social cost of a disease is extremely low, akin
to the common cold, will the planner allow the disease to become endemic.
We expand our analysis to an SIR model that is calibrated to capture the
epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 and the US economy. Again, we nd
and prove that infected individuals who behave individually rationally engage
in excessive levels of economic activity because they disregard the infection
externalities that they impose upon the susceptible. In our numerical simulations based on standard statistical value of life considerations, we show that
private agents perceive the cost of an additional infection to be around $80k
whereas the true social cost including infection externalities is more than three
times higher, around

$286k,

when the fraction of infected agents is 1%.

Focusing on dynamics, this misvaluation has stark implications for how
society ultimately overcomes the disease: for a population of individually rational agents, the main focus is precautionary behavior by the susceptible,
which attens the curve of infections. However, in the decentralized setting,
the disease is not overcome until herd immunity is acquired.

The resulting

economic cost is high: an initial sharp decline in aggregate output by about
8% is followed by a slow recovery that takes several years. By contrast, the
socially optimal approach in our model focuses public policy measures on the
infected in order to contain and eradicate the disease. Since the infected make
up a smaller fraction of the population, this produces a much milder recession.
A natural concern is that targeting the infected is dicult since many
countries, including the US, have suered from shortages in testing kits, and
because COVID-19 has a long incubation period and a signicant fraction of
infected individuals are asymptomatic. To capture this situation, we analyze a
version of our model in which the epidemiological status of individuals is hidden
so the planner has to choose a uniform level of economic activity for all agents.
Even in that case, the social planner aggressively contains and eradicates the
disease. However this must now be achieved through a reduction in the level
of activity of all agents, generating a decline in aggregate output that is much
more severe, about 17%, but followed by a speedy recovery once the disease

4

is contained. When the planner cannot distinguish the epidemiological status
of agents, the social cost of an extra infection is more than twice as high as
when the planner can target infected individuals, about $576k.
In an extension of our model, we compare the private and social gains from
vaccination.

Individually rational susceptible agents nd vaccines useful for

two reasons: rst, they no longer face the risk of costly infection and secondly
they no longer need to incur the cost of social distancing to avoid becoming
infected.

Vaccines are most useful in a society in which social distancing is

determined by individually rational behavior.

When noone in such a popu-

lation has immunity, the private gain from an individual vaccination is $26k,
falling to $1.8k when her immunity is acquired since the risk of infection falls.
By contrast, a planner would perceive the social gain from vaccination nearly
17 times larger, at $430k when there is zero immunity in the population. In
a society in which public health measures are imposed by a planner and the
disease is quickly eradicated through social distancing, the value of vaccines is
considerably lower.

Literature

In the economics literature, our work is most closely related to

Goldman and Lightwood (2002), Gersovitz and Hammer (2003, 2004) and
Gersovitz (2011) who study externalities of health interventions for infectious diseases in SIS and SIR models. Georgiy et al. (2011) show cross-country
externalities in responding to u pandemics. Our addition to this strand of literature is (i) to analyze the economic eects of the specic non-pharmaceutical
interventions relevant for COVID-19  social distancing  and (ii) to contribute
a quantitative analysis to the evaluation of COVID-19 infection externalities
to better inform the policy debate.
Our work is also related to recent papers who analyze optimal non-pharmaceutical controls in SIR models calibrated to COVID-19, that feature a tradeo
of economic activity and disease transmission. Alvarez et al. (2020) and Eichenbaum et al. (2020) characterize optimal disease control in SIR models in
which the transmission of disease depends on economic choices. We complement these papers by providing analytic results on the externalities that arise

5

in both SIS and SIR models and by quantifying by how much individually rational agents undervalue the cost of infection. Our ndings also highlight the
crucial role of testing, as suggested in Berger et al. (2020) and Piguillem and
Shi (2020).

We also provide quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the

externalities imposed by COVID-19 and formulate policy as a function of the
measure of infected and susceptible agents. We rely on various estimates of the
rate of COVID-19 transmission, death rates, and hospital capacity provided
by Atkeson (2020), Verity et al. (2020), and others. Our work complements
the collection of recent economics papers that analyze the role of scal policy
(e.g. E Castro, 2020) or spillover eects caused by COVID-19 (e.g. Guerrieri
et al., 2020).

2.1

First Step: An SIS Economy
Model Setup

In this section, we develop a simple SIS model that introduces a role for economic decision-making, an analysis of welfare and an expression of the externalities that arise. Although the SIS model omits important characteristics of
diseases such as COVID-19, it illustrates the basic structure of the problem
and allows us to analyze the interactions between economics and epidemiology in utmost clarity. We will build on this setting below to provide a richer
description of externalities in the SIR model.

Epidemiology

Let us denote the mass of susceptible individuals by

the mass of infected individuals by

identical. Time is continuous and goes on forever. We follow the convention
in the epidemiological literature of dropping the time subscript of

Social Planner

Let us now contrast the outcome in a decentralized setting with what would
be socially optimal if a planner who must obey the epidemiological laws can
determine the path of individual actions

{aS , aI }.

The planner would maximize

overall social welfare, consisting of the integral over the utility (4) of the unit
mass of agents

j â [0, 1],
Z
W =

U dj

where the epidemiological status of individuals follows the epidemiological law
(2).
For a given value of inital infections

I (0),

the problem of the planner can

be captured by the current-value Hamiltonian

H = I [u (aI ) â c (I)] + (1 â I) u (aS ) â WI [Î² (aI , aS ) I (1 â I) â Î³I]
plus the transversality condition

limT ââ eârT WI = 0, where WI

is the current-

value shadow cost of an agent being infected. The resulting optimality conditions are

u0 (aâS ) = WI Â· Î²0 aâI I

(8)

u0 (aâI ) = WI Â· Î²0 aâS (1 â I)

(10)
where we denote by an asterisk the planner's choices.

Denition 2

.

(Planner's Allocation in SIS Economy)

10

For given

I (0),

the

planner's allocation in the described SIS system is given by a path of the
epidemiological variable

I

paths of action variables

that follows the epidemiological law (2) as well as

(aâS , aâI )

and the shadow cost

WI

that satisfy the

planner's optimization problem.
The optimality condition for

aâS

mirrors the equivalent expression (5) in the

decentralized equilibrium  individual agents and the planner both account for
the risk of infection of susceptible agents in a similar manner. However, the
planner's shadow price of infection

WI

diers from that of decentralized agents,

which we describe below. In our simulations we found that generally

VI < WI

so the planner values the cost of acquiring the infection more highly than
private agents and will act in a more precautionary manner than private agents
for given parameter values.

The second optimality condition for

aâI

diers

from the optimality condition of private agents: the planner captures that the
activity of infected agents increases the infection risk of the susceptible, which
individual agents disregard.
The third optimality condition captures the law of motion of the planner's shadow price of infection.

In addition to the costs captured by indi-

vidual agents in the decentralized equilibrium, the term

Ic0 (I)

reects that

at the aggregate level, the cost of infections is convex, and the extra term

WI Î² (Â·) (1 â I)

reects that the planner internalizes that additional infections

will transmit to the current population of susceptible agents. We summarize
our results as follows:

Proposition 1

.

(Infection Externalities in SIS Economy)

The planner in-

ternalizes the infection externalities of the infected and would choose a lower
level of activity for infected agents,

aâI < aI .

For given actions, the planner

experiences a higher social cost of infection than private agents,

WI > VI .

Proof. See discussion above.
Whether the planner will induce more or less activity for susceptible agents
than in the decentralized equilibrium for given

I

depends on two competing

forces: since the infected engage in less activity, the risk of infection for susceptible agents is lower, generating a force toward greater activity; however, for

11

given actions, the planner recognizes a greater social loss from one more indi-

WI > VI , generating a force toward lower levels of

than decentralized agents.

Corollary 1

.

(Decentralizing the SIS Economy)

The planner can implement

her allocation in a decentralized setting in the following ways:
1. by imposing taxes on the activities of susceptible and infected agents
and

aI

aS

such that

ÏI = WI Â· Î²0 aâS (1 â I) > 0
ÏS = (WI â VI ) Î²0 aâ IÂ¯ > 0

(11)
(12)

I

2. by imposing a tax (11) on the activity of infected

aI ,

and a utility penalty

on becoming infected of

ÏV = WI â VI > 0
3. by imposing a tax (11) on the activity of infected

(13)

aI ,

and a utility penalty

or equivalent tax on being infected such that

ÏC = Ic0 (I) + WI Â· Î² (Â·) (1 â I) > 0

(14)

as well as any appropriate combination of the three instruments ÏS , ÏV , ÏC .
Formulating the dierent ways of decentralizing the SIS economy is not
necessarily meant to provide hands-on policy guidance (especially for points
2. and 3.) Instead, we describe the three options because they oer three complementary ways to understand the infection externalities in our framework.
Clearly, as captured by point 1., it is the actions of the susceptible and infected
that ultimately need to change to implement the socially optimal allocation.
However, the sole reason why the behavior of the susceptible is distorted is
that they misperceive the social cost of being infected. As point 2. illustrates,

12

this implies that correcting the shadow price of becoming infected by imposing an extra penalty would induce the socially optimal level of activity among
the susceptible. Moreover, as claried in point 3., the undervaluation of the
shadow price of infection arises simply because infected individuals  even once
we have induced them to engage in the socially optimal level of activity  do
not internalize the potential cost that they impose on others, captured by the
right-hand side of (14), which consists both of the increase in the cost

are well-insured, including if they receive social insurance against idiosyncratic
shocks. By contrast, if some individuals lose their jobs and incomes whereas
others can continue to work, additional welfare costs arise (see e.g. Guerrieri
et al., 2020).
The cost of disease captures both the disutility of being sick and, in reduced
form, the potential risk of death.

In the analysis of public policies, e.g. sa-

fety regulations or environmental policies, economists routinely have to weigh
decisions that compare economic benets and health costs. Estimates of the
implied cost of adverse health events are obtained by evaluating how much individuals are willing to spend to avoid a given risk of an adverse event. Based
on guidance from the US Department of Transportation (2012) on the value
of a statistical life by consumer price ination, a current estimate in the US
is around $10.3m at the age of the median worker of approximately 40 years.
By comparison, before the pandemic, the weekly level of economic activity in
the US as measured by GDP was approximately $1200/capita. In our model,

However, a striking feature of COVID-19 is that the case fatality rate depends strongly on age (Verity et al., 2020), ranging from virtually zero for

al (2020)'s case fatality rates with life expectancy data from the SSA, Table
A1 shows that the expected statistical loss of life years for an average infected
individual in the US is 0.136 years. Using the procedure described by Atkins
and Bradford (2020) and a discount rate of 4%, we translate the $10.3m statistical value of life into a $498k value of a statistical life year.

One of the concerns about COVID-19 is its

potential to overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare system since about 15%
of cases require hospitalization and about 5% of cases require mechanical ventilators. (Given the early stage of medical research, there is still considerable
uncertainty about these parameter values.) The US currently has only about
200,000 ventilators available. Assuming the best available distribution to the
places where they are needed and no other demand for ventilators by chronically sick patients, this implies that at most .06% of the population can be
served at a given time. If the infection rate rises above

I = .06%/5% = .012,

mortality will rise signicantly, as experienced in earlier hotspots such as Wuhan or Northern Italy.

We set

Îº = 1/.012/2 â 40

to reect that the cost

of disease is an increasing function of the fraction of the population that is
infected. In summary, the parameters for our baseline calibration of the cost
of disease are

(c0 , Îº) = (14, 40).

To explore the full range of outcomes in the SIS model, we also consider
a low-cost disease for which individuals experience just a minor reduction
in utility, akin to e.g. the common cold.

r = 5%
(c0 , Îº) = (0.05, 0)

Without appealing to any specic

disease, we set

Intuitively, the planner relents on the activity reduction of the infected since
there are fewer and fewer agents left to whom they could pass on the infection.
In the low-cost scenario (lower panels of Figure 2), there is a discontinuity
around

I (0) = 0.16:

when the initial fraction of the population is suciently

low, the planner chooses to eradicate the disease as in the baseline scenario.
However, when the initial disease burden is higher, it is no longer optimal
to incur the cost of eradication, and the planner instead chooses a steady
state with a positive disease burden that is slightly below the steady state of
decentralized agents, internalizing the infection externalities.
The upper panels of Figure 3 simulate the paths of the SIS economy for

The solutions in the

decentralized economy and under the planner diverge  the disease remains
endemic in the decentralized economy, with the fraction of infected converging
to an interior steady state, whereas the planner eradicates the disease. The
middle panel shows that the lives of susceptible agents quickly return to normal
under the planner's solution, whereas decentralized agents nd it optimal to
progressively reduce their activity as

To accomplish a rapid eradication,

the planner isolates infected agents by reducing their economic activity to near
zero, which mitigates the harm to the susceptible. The ecient solution relies
on the planner's ability to identify and isolate the the sick, highlighting the
role of testing which we explore in later sections.
What is particularly interesting is that the shadow cost of an additional
infection as perceived by the planner is signicantly greater than what decentralized agents perceive. Private agents disregard the infection externalities,
whereas the planner recognizes that additional infections cost not only the affected agents but also pose a risk to others. In the baseline scenario, the cost of
infection is an increasing function of

I

for both the decentralized and the plan-

ner's allocation because more infections imply greater risk for the susceptible
as well as more externalities and (for the planner) a higher cost of reducing
the activity of infected agents.

20

The lower panels of Figure 3 show the paths of the economy for an initial
level of infection

I (0) that is above the planner's eradication threshold under a

low cost-of-disease scenario. In that case, the planner focuses on slowing down
the rate of infection to preserve the higher utility of uninfected agents, and then
converges to a steady state

I

that is slightly below the decentralized steady

state. The right-hand panel shows that the planner recognizes the utility loss
from infection to be a multiple of what decentralized agents perceive  because
she internalizes the infection externalities generated by an additional infected
agent. Moreover, the marginal cost of an additional infection is now decreasing
over time as the economy approaches the steady state.

Comparing the allocations of decentralized agents and the planner, we

but the same

Proof. See discussion above.
As in our discussion follow Proposition 1, the planner's eects on the activity level of susceptible agents depends on the two competing forces: since the
infected engage in less activity, the risk of infection for susceptible agents is
lower, generating a force toward greater activity; however, for given actions,
the planner recognizes a greater social loss from one more individual becoming
infected,

WI > VI ,

generating a force toward lower levels of activity.

The social planner's allocation can be decentralized in a similar fashion to
what we discussed in Corollary 1 for the SIS economy:

23

Corollary 2 (Decentralizing the SIR Economy).

The planner can implement

her allocation in a decentralized setting in the three ways discussed in Corollary
1.

3.3

SIR Results

We keep the parameterization from the baseline scenario of Section 2.3 but
now account for the fact that recovered individuals are resistant to re-infection.
Computationally, we solve a non-linear four-dimensional boundary value problem in

(I, R, VI , VR )

with conditions

I(0) > 0, R(0) = 0

and the two trans-

versality conditions. The boundary conditions for the planner's solution are
equivalent in the corresponding system in

(I, R, WI , WR ),

where again the al-

gorithm must check for a global optimum across potentially multiple paths that
satisfy the system given by equations (19), (20), (26),(28), and the boundary
conditions.
Figure 4 illustrates the path of the disease in the decentralized and planner's allocation starting from an initial infection rate of

I (0) =1%,

which is

close to estimates of the true number of COVID-19 cases in the US in the
rst half of April, given that the fraction of undiagnosed cases is signicant
(Verity et al., 2020), and setting

R (0) = 0.

In the decentralized economy,

susceptible agents reduce their economic activity but infections continue to
rise for the rst 12 weeks. As the higher fraction of infected increases the risk
for susceptible agents, they continue to reduce their economic activity until
infection activity peaks. Subsequently, the rising number of recovered agents
in the population together with still very cautious behavior by the susceptible
leads to a decline in the fraction of infected, allowing susceptible agents to
increase economic activity again. One striking observation is that even after
two years, the epidemic is still ongoing: the fraction of infected in the population is still 0.5%, whereas close to half of the population has recovered and
acquired resistance (middle panel).
Taken together, once could say that the extremely cautious behavior of
the susceptible has attened the curve, but ultimately the mechanism that

24

overcomes the epidemic is to acquire herd immunity, i.e. to acquire sucient
resistance in the population so that the epidemic dies out. Given the externalities, infected agents simply do not nd it individually rational to engage in
the severe measures that would be necessary to contain the disease.
The planner, by contrast, aims to eradicate the disease as quickly as possible by reducing activity by the infected to close to zero, even though this
imposes a stark utility cost on infected agents given the Inada condition

limaâ0 u0I (a) = â.

After eight weeks, the fraction of infected is suciently

close to zero that the planner allows infected individuals to raise their economic
activity. However, observe that all throughout, the planner allows susceptible
agents  who make up the majority of the population  to engage in almost
full activity. In short, one could say that the planner's strategy to overcome
the epidemic is containment and eradication, i.e. to drive down the number of
infected suciently so that it no longer poses a risk to the susceptible, even
though they never acquire herd immunity. This illustrates the stark dierence
in how the disease is overcome by decentralized agents versus the planner.
These results crucially hinge on the assumption that the epidemiological
status of individuals is observable. In practice, widespread shortages in testing
capacity as well as the considerable number of asymptomatic cases that are still
potentially able to spread the disease currently make it dicult to implement
what we have characterized as the planner's optimal strategy. For comparison, we consider the case in which the epidemiological status of individuals is
unobservable in Section 3.4.
To provide additional intuition on the dierences between the decentralized
outcome and the planner's solution, the left-hand panel of Figure 5 illustrates
how private agents and the planner perceive the marginal cost of an additional infection

VI

versus

WI .

The rst observation is that the planner's

is signicantly higher than private agents'

VI ,

WI

for two reasons: rst, she in-

ternalizes that infected agents spread the disease, and secondly she induces
infected agents to starkly reduce their level of economic activity. At the initial
level of infected

I (0) = 1%,

private agents perceive the cost of infection to be

when we converted the statistical value of life years into utils). The social cost
of an additional infection as perceived by the planner, by contrast, is much
larger and corresponds to approximately

$286k  about three-and-a-half times

higher than what decentralized agents perceive. Furthermore, the social cost
of infection rises in

overwhelming the capacity of the healthcare system, raising the social cost of

By contrast, the planner reduces the economic activity of the infected to near
zero while maintaining activity for the susceptible near normal levels.
To verify the robustness of our ndings, Figure 6 illustrates an alternative
scenario in which we only consider the purely economic cost of the disease with

c(I) = c0 = 1.7

 this is 88% less than the cost in our baseline scenario that

was derived from the statistical value of life calculation in Section 2.3. The
planner's solution is nearly identical, with rapid containment and elimination

of the disease. By contrast, the disease spreads more rapidly in the decentralized economy since susceptible agents engage in less precautionary behavior
when the cost of disease is lower. They cut back on activity in proportion to
the fraction

I,

which drives their risk of infection. In the long-run, over 70%

of the population experiences an infection (middle-panel) compared to 50%
in the baseline. There continues to be a discrepancy between the private and

and

3.4

Hidden Epidemiological Status

Following a containment and elimination strategy that focuses on the infected,
as we found optimal in our analysis above, requires that the epidemiological
status of individuals is readily identiable. This has been dicult for many
countries, not only because COVID-19 has a long incubation period, up to
14 days, and a signicant fraction of infected individuals are asymptomatic
(Verity et al., 2020), but also because many countries, including the US, have
suered from shortages in testing kits. Whereas our baseline model assumed

27

Figure 6: Dynamic paths starting from

I(0) = 0.01

under

c0 = 1.7

and

Îº = 0.

that individuals and the planner can easily target their chosen actions to the
epidemiological status of a given individual, the reality is that many are unaware of their epidemiological status. To analyze the implications of this lack of
information, we now consider the extreme case that the epidemiological status

i

of an individual is hidden so that the planner needs to chose a uniform level

of activity

aÌ

that does not depend on epidemiological status.

This modies the Hamiltonian (21) of the planner so that there is just a
single decision variable

hidden epidemiological status, the planner internalizes twice the infection risk
perceived by decentralized agents for a given cost of infection. Furthermore,
for given actions, the planner perceives a higher social cost of infection than
private agents,

WI > VI .

Proof. See discussion above.
The reason why the planner internalizes twice the expected cost of infection
is that she recognizes that it is not only the actions of the susceptible that
matter but also the actions of the infected agents.
Figure 7 illustrates the dynamic path of the disease starting from an infection rate of 1%. The left and middle panels reproduce the paths of infections
and levels of activity

ai

from Figure 4 and add (red dash-dotted) lines for the

planner who cannot distinguish the infection status of individuals. The path
of infections is virtually unchanged from the solution of a planner who can
distinguish epidemiological status  the planner still contains and quickly eliminates the virus; however this must now be achieved through a reduction
of the level of activity of all agents.

The middle panel shows that the level

of activity of all agents is initially reduced close to 25% of the normal level,
increasing back to 75% over the span of 11 weeks, and then slowly returning
to normal.

29

The right panel illustrates the impact on aggregate output, including the
fraction

1 â Ï = 0.75

of output that does not require physical/social inte-

raction which we assumed remains unaected. In the decentralized economy
with epidemiological status visible, output initially declines by 8% and continues to fall as the disease spreads, then gradually returning to normal. Still,
after nearly two years output is 5% below normal. In the planner's case with
epidemiological status visible, the recession is much smaller and shorter-lived:
aggregate output initially falls by 0.5% then returns to virtually normal within
6 weeks. By contrast, when the planner cannot detect the status of individuals
and must resort to blunter measures that are independent of epidemiological
status, she induces a recession that is large but considerably shorter-lived than
in the decentralized economy. Aggregate output is initially reduced by 17%
and returns to 5% below normal after 13 weeks, far outpacing the economic
recovery in the decentralized economy  even if individuals are aware of their
epidemiological status.
When the planner cannot distinguish the epidemiological status of agents,
the social cost of infection is higher, as shown in the left-panel of Figure 8.
At an initial infection rate of 1%, the social cost is $576k, more than twice as
high as when the planner can separately reduce the activity of the infected and
more than seven times as high as what is perceived by decentralized agents
who know their epidemiological status. The planner internalizes that even for
a small initial outbreak, they must impose economic costs across all agents,
which leads to large social costs. The right panel of Figure 8 shows that the
planner, under hidden epidemiological status (red dash-dotted line), reduces
economic activity by more than 50% and, if the fraction infected is 5%, by up
to 85%.

3.5

Private versus Social Gains from Vaccination

The future economic damage imposed by the virus will depend heavily on
how soon a vaccine is developed. Individually rational susceptible agents have
incentives to become vaccinated in order to avoid the risk of infection. In our

30

Figure 8: Cost of disease and economic activity as a function of
status (for

I

under hidden

R = 0)

SIR model, the benet of moving from susceptible to resistant is reected by

VR

in equation (25). The ow gains over time are captured by two terms. The

rst term,

uR â u(aS ),

captures that recovered agents do not have to distance

themselves in order to avoid becoming infected.

The second term,

VI Î²(Â·)I ,

captures the expected gain from avoiding the infection entirely.
The left panel of Figure 9 illustrates the private gain from a vaccination
(solid-blue line) when 1% of the population is infected, for

R â [0, 0.99].

Ini-

tially if no one has immunity, the private gain from becoming vaccinated is
equivalent to $26k.

The gain falls as more of the population becomes re-

sistant/recovered as this reduces the risk of infection.

Around

R = 0.6

population acquires herd immunity, and the private gain to an additional
vaccination declines to $1.8k as the infection risk of susceptible individuals
becomes negligible.
However, since private agents do not internalize the infection externality,
the social gain of an additional vaccination in the decentralized economy is
many times larger, shown as the dashed-purple line in the left panel of 9,

Conclusions

We integrate macroeconomic activity into epidemiological SIS and SIR models
in order to analyze and quantify the externalities that arise. Our main nding
is that agents who behave individually rationally generate large externalities
because they do not internalize the eects of their economic and social activities on the infection risk of others and therefore engage in inadequate social
distancing. Infected agents rationally choose to engage in full economic activity, while susceptible agents reduce activity which attens the spread of the
virus. However full recovery only occurs after herd immunity is reached across
several years.
We nd in a model calibrated to capture the main features of COVID-19
and the US economy that private agents perceive the cost of an additional
infection to be around $80k whereas the true social cost is more than three
times higher, around $286k.

Facing an initial outbreak in which 1% of the

population is infected, the planner optimally isolates the infected by reducing
their social activity close to zero while only slightly reducing the activity of the
susceptible. This leads to a sharp reduction in the number of infected agents
and an overall mild impact on aggregate output.
Alternatively, if the planner cannot make policy contingent on the epidemiological status of individuals, for instance either because of the asymptomatic
nature of COVID-19 or the lack of sucient testing, then optimal policy still
sharply reduces the number of infections but at signicantly larger initial economic cost but that is short lived. The social cost of an additional infection
in this scenario is around $576k.
We leave several possible extensions for future work: First, it would be
useful to rene our epidemiological models to account for additional nuances
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For example, including a separate compartments
for exposed agents E would make it possible to explicitly account for the long
incubation period of COVID-19 and for the possibility that exposed agents
recover without ever displaying symptoms of the disease. Accounting for spatial heterogeneity would make it possible to better capture the dynamics of

33

the disease in a large country such as the US and to analyze the benets of
travel restrictions. Moreover, since the case fatality rate of COVID-19 diers
so strongly for patients of dierent age, accounting for dierent age groups
would make it possible to analyze how the externalities by age group dier.
Secondly, it would be useful to rene the analysis of the macroeconomic
feedback eects of the reductions in social and economic activity that we analyze.

For example, Guerrieri et al. (2020) show that feedback eects in a

multi-sector economy with nancial market imperfections may lead to an amplication of the initial shock generated by social distancing.

This provides

valuable insights for macroeconomic policymakers.
