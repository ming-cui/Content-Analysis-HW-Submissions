Macroeconomic Dynamics and Reallocation in an Epidemic
Dirk Krueger, Harald Uhlig, and Taojun Xie
NBER Working Paper No. 27047
April 2020
JEL No. E20,E30,E52
ABSTRACT
In this paper we argue that endogenous shifts in private consumption behavior across sectors of
the economy can act as a potent mitigation mechanism during an epidemic or when the economy
is re-opened after a temporary lockdown. Extending the theoretical framework proposed by
Eichenbaum-Rebelo-Trabandt (2020), we distinguish goods by their degree to which they can be
consumed at home rather than in a social (and thus possibly contagious) context. We demonstrate
that, within the model the "Swedish solution" of letting the epidemic play out without
government intervention and allowing agents to shift their sectoral behavior on their own can lead
to a substantial mitigation of the economic and human costs of the COVID-19 crisis, avoiding
more than 80 of the decline in output and of number of deaths within one year, compared to a
model in which sectors are assumed to be homogeneous. For different parameter configurations
that capture the additional social distancing and hygiene activities individuals might engage in
voluntarily, we show that infections may decline entirely on their own, simply due to the
individually rational re-allocation of economic activity: the curve not only just flattens, it gets
reversed.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has the world in its grip. Policy makers must wrestle with a serious
trade-o↵: how much economic activity should one allow, possibly risking hundreds of thousands additional deaths as a result? Our paper contributes to the quickly growing literature of understanding this
trade-o↵. Our specific focus is on the question how people can deal with that trade-o↵ on their own
already: how much will each individual seek to mitigate economic interactions that carry the risk of
infection, given the potentially disastrous consequences for their health?
Our starting point is a simple macroeconomic model, where agents consume and work, combined with
a SIR (“Susceptible-Infected-Recovered”) model standard in the epidemiology literature. Our analysis
is inspired by and shares many features with the model of Eichenbaum et al. (2020), ERT for short from
now on. As in their model infections can occur in the market place by consuming together or working
together. We also share with these authors, that participating agents are aware of the resulting infectionand death-risks, and thus may alter their consumption and work patterns as the epidemic unfolds, but
do not take into account the externality of their behavior on the infection risks of others. Like them,
we view the endogenous response in behaviour of people, motivated by their own interest in preserving
their health and avoiding the possibility of dying, as key in understanding the spread of a pandemic and,
ultimately, its economic costs, a significant advance from the purely epidemiological models beautifully
summarized in Atkeson (2020).
We depart from ERT in one crucial dimension, however. In contrast to them we assume the economy
is composed of several heterogeneous sectors that di↵er technologically in their infection probabilities.
There are two interpretations of this assumption. One is, that very similar goods can be consumed in
privacy at home ( Pizza delivery ) rather than in the market place (Pizza restaurant). Likewise, very
similar work may be performed remotely rather than in an office, e.g. writing a report online at home
rather than in the community of co-workers. Leibovici et al. (2020) provide evidence for very substantial
heterogeneity across sectors of the U.S. in the degree of social interaction to facilitate the production of
goods and services, and Dingel and Neimann (2020) as well as Mongey and Weinberg (2020) assess what
share of jobs can be performed at home, and Toxvaerd (2020) provides an equilibrium in which social
distancing is an equilibrium outcome emerging from individually rational behavior. Consistent with our
main mechanism, Farboodi et al. (2020) provide evidence from US micro-data for a large reduction in
social activity by private household even prior to the implementation of public stay-at-home-orders and
lockdowns of economic activity.
The elasticity of substitution across goods (or work activities), denoted by ⌘ in our paper, can
reasonably assumed to be fairly high: we choose ⌘ = 10 as our benchmark, following Fernandez-Villaverde

2

(2010). An alternative interpretation is that these are rather distinct goods and distinct lines or work,
and that substitutability may be lower: for that interpretation, we choose ⌘ = 3, following Adhmad
and Riker (2019). Furthermore, in our benchmark parameterization, the infection probability in the
most infectious sector (for the same consumption or work intensity) is nine times as high as in the least
infectious sector.
We interpret the term “consumption” in this paper broadly and applicable to non-market social
activities as well. The substitution discussion above is relevant just as much for partying together
with friends as opposed to talking online, for congregating in parks as opposed to staying at home,
to demonstrating against some cause together in the streets rather than sending petitions per e-mail.
Viewed from that perspective, infection is inexorably linked to consumption or work place interaction,
and we shall assume as much in our analysis.
We show that the resulting economic and health outcomes di↵er dramatically as a result. In the
economy with homogeneous sectors, we obtain a deep decline of economic activity of ten percent, precisely
as in ERT (in a calibration chosen to make our analysis exactly comparable to theirs). In contrast, more
than eighty percent of that decline is mitigated in our benchmark economy with heterogeneous sectors.
Likewise 80 percent of the deaths are avoided after the first year, compared to the homogeneous sector
version. Despite the lack of any government intervention, the “curve” is flattened substantially. For
di↵erent parameter configurations that capture the additional social distancing and hygiene activities
which individuals might engage in voluntarily, we show that infections may decline entirely on their own,
simply due to the re-allocation of economic activity: the curve does not just flattens, it gets reversed.
One may view our results as the prediction for the “Swedish” solution: Sweden has largely avoided
government restrictions on economic activity, allowing people to make their own choices. The outcomes
in terms of the disease spread nonetheless are largely in line with other European countries, which have
imposed far more Draconian measures, while the output decline is considerably mitigated. One may also
view our results as telling a cautiously optimistic tale about the potential for re-opening economies after
a temporary lock down. Put di↵erently, private incentives and well-functioning labor markets as well as
social insurance policies or markets (that serve to insure those for which transition into di↵erent sectors
in the economy takes time or is costly) may solve the COVID-19 spread rather e↵ectively on their own,
mitigating the decline in economic activity and in human costs.
Our results are stark, partially because our analysis assumes smoothly functioning labor markets
where workers can quickly reallocate to the sectors now in demand: waiters at restaurants deliver food
instead, for example. It is easy to argue that the world is not as frictionless as assumed here and that
the message of our paper is perhaps a bit too Panglossian. We do not wish to argue that the substantial
mitigation happens as easily on its own. The analysis here does show, however, that recognition of
3

substitution possibilities and recognition of private incentives of agents to become infected is potentially
an important aspect in thinking about the current pandemic, both its onset but also its evolution as the
economy is again opened to activity following the lock-down implemented in many countries.
Our analysis relates to other recent work that has emphasized the need to think about a multisector
economy for the purpose of analyzing the economic e↵ect of the recent epidemic, such as Alvarez et al.
(2020), Glover et al. (2020), Guerrieri et al. (2020) or Kaplan et al. (2020). However, these authors
do not feature the feedback from the di↵erential infection probabilities across sectors into the private
reallocation decision making of agents. A second very active literature evaluates the impact of publicly
enforced mobility restrictions and social distancing measures on the dynamics of an epidemic, see e.g.
Correia et al. (2020), Fang et al. (2020) or Greenstone and Nigam (2020). Complementary to this work
we emphasize that private incentives to redirect consumption behavior might go a long way towards
mitigating or even averting the epidemic, even in the absence of mobility restrictions or publicly enforced
social distancing measures.
This paper is meant to clarify the key forces, rather than painting a nuanced and detailed picture of
the quantities. We therefore focus first, in the model developed in section 2, on the infection risk in the
consumption sector only. In section 3 we provide theoretical results that demonstrate the importance of
the elasticity of substitution across sectors, and also argue that the same mechanism is at work if the risk
of infections is located in the labor market rather than the consumption goods market, though one may
wish to argue that the relevant elasticity of substitution is lower in that case. In section 4 we examine the
optimal choices of a social planner who can observe which agents are infected and which are not, akin to
the planning problem studied by Alvarez et al. (2020) One may think of this as a strong government with
wide testing capabilities1 of individuals, or a sufficiently powerful appeal to in particular the infected
agents to do what is good for the country. Section 5 contains the quantitative results, showing how
individually rational reallocation of economic activity across sectors is a strong mitigating force of the
crisis even in the absence of explicit government intervention. It also shows that the social planner can
stop the pandemic in its tracks early and quickly. This should not be all that surprising: the social
planner simply prevents infected agents from co-mingling with the susceptible part of the population (by
separating consumption of both groups across sectors), even if this imposes considerable, additional pain
on the infected agents, which the social planner of course takes into account. What is more surprising,
though, is that the decentralized solution with its substitution possibilities can get us there already 80
percent of the way on its own.
1 In

this sense our social planner analysis is akin in spirit to the focus on testing in Berger et al. (2020).

2.1

The macroeconomic environment

Our framework builds on Eichenbaum-Rebelo-Trabandt (2020) or ERT for short, and shares some key
model components. Time is discrete, t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., measuring weeks. There is a continuum j 2 [0, 1] of
individuals, maximizing the objective function

U = E0

and where expectations E0 are taken with respect to stochastic health transitions describe delow in
detail. Like ERT, we assume that preferences are given by

u(c, n) = ln c

In contrast to ERT, we assume that consumption cjt takes the form of a bundle across a continuum of
sectors k 2 [0, 1],

0 denotes the elasticity of substitution across goods and cjtk is the consumption of individual

j at date t of sector k goods. Workers can split their work across all sectors and earn a wage Wt in units
of a numeraire good2 for a unit of labor, regardless where they work. As the choice of the numeraire is
arbitrary, we let a unit of labor denote that numeraire: thus, wages are equal to unity, Wt = 1.
Goods of sector k are priced at Ptk in terms of the numeraire, i.e. in units of labor. We suppose
that production of goods in sector k is linear in labor, i.e. total output of goods in sector k equals the
total number of hours worked there times some aggregate productivity factor A, and that pricing in each
sector is competitive. Thus, prices equal marginal costs and are the same across all sectors,

Ptk = Pt = 1/A
2 The

presentation of the model is easier assuming a numeraire rather than payment in a bundle of consumption goods.
We will not examine sticky prices or sticky wages in this model.

The epidemic

As in ERT, we assume that the population will be divided into four groups: the “susceptible” people
of mass St , who are not immune and may still contract the disease but are not currently infected, the
“infected” people of mass It , the “recovered” people of mass Rt and the dead of mass Dt . We assume
that the risk of becoming infected, and the rate of death or recovery do not depend on the sector of
work, but exclusively depend on consumption interactions. Our focus here is on the sectoral shift in
consumption: for simplicity and in contrast to ERT, we assume that infected individuals continue to
work at full productivity, but that the disease can only spread due to interacting consumers. We show
in subsection 3.2, that this is similar to a model, where the infection can only spread via the workplace.
In our robustness analysis, we also allow for the additional, purely mechanical possibility of autonomous
transmissions from infected to susceptible individuals, regardless of their choices.
Di↵erent goods or, perhaps better, di↵erent ways of consuming rather similar goods di↵er in the
contagiousness. To that end, we assume that there is an increasing function

: [0, 1] ! [0, 1], where

(k) measures the degree of social interaction or relative contagiousness of consumption in sector k (or
variety k of a consumption good). We normalize this function to integrate to unity,
Z

(k)dk = 1

(3)

Consider an agent j, who is still “susceptible”: we denote this agent therefore with “s” rather than
j. This agent is consuming the bundle (cstk )k2[0,1] at date t. Symmetrically, let (citk )k2[0,1] denote the
consumption bundle of infected people. Extending ERT, we assume that the probability ⌧ts for an agent
of type s to become infected depends on his own consumption bundle, on the total mass of infected
people and their consumption choices, and the degree (k) to which infection can be spread per unit of
consumption in sector k,

⌧ t = ⇡s I t

Z

(k)cstk citk dk + ⇡a It ,

(4)

where ⇡s is a parameter for the social-interaction infection risk. For the robustness exercise later on, we
have also included the autonomous infection risk parameter ⇡a . With (4), the total number of newly
3 Di↵erent from ERT, we do not feature a tax-like general consumption discouragement and thus no government transfers.
We also abstract from capital and thus from intertemporal savings decisions, at they do.

where ⇡r is the recovery rate and ⇡d is the death rate, and where Popt denotes the mass of the total

S0 = 1

2.3

✏, as well as R0 = D0 = 0.

Choices

We proceed to analyze the choices of the individuals.
Susceptible people:

Denote as Uts (Uti ) the lifetime utility, from period t on, of a currently susceptible

(infected) individual. As in ERT, the lifetime utility Uts follows the recursion
Uts = u(cst , nst ) + [(1

s
i
⌧t )Ut+1
+ ⌧t Ut+1
]

(11)

where the probability ⌧t is given in equation (4) and depends on the choice of the consumption bundle
(cstk )k2[0,1] . An s-person maximizes the right hand side of (11) subject to the budget constraint (2) and
the infection probability constraint (4), by choosing labor nst , the consumption bundle (cstk )k2[0,1] and
the infection probability ⌧t .
The first-order condition for consumption of cstk is

Equation (13) reveals, that the risk of becoming infected induces an additional goods-specific component,
scaled with the aggregate multiplicator ⌫t , compared to the usual first order conditions for Dixit-Stiglitz
consumption aggregators (at constant prices across goods). In the absence of the impact of consumption
on infection

rt

= ⌫t = 0 and there is no consumption heterogeneity across sectors, cstk = cst for all k, as

in the standard model. In the presence of this e↵ect, then susceptible households shift their consumption
to sectors with low risk of infection (i.e. those with a low (k)citk ).
Taking the consumption profile of infected households (citk ) as given, by choosing her consumption
portfolio a susceptible individual e↵ectively chooses her infection probability ⌧t . As in ERT, the first-order
condition for ⌧t reads as

(20)

That is, as long as ⌘ 2 (0, 1), infected individuals find it optimal to spread their consumption evenly
across sectors, given that all sector goods have the same price, are imperfect substitutes, and di↵erential
infection probabilities across sectors are irrelevant for already infected individuals. Exploiting this result
and the specific form of the period utility function (which implies u1 (c, n) = 1/c) in equation (19) yields
1/cit =

Likewise, the lifetime utility for a recovered person is

Given our assumptions, the optimal decision for both the i group and r group is the same4 : we will
therefore use cit , cit,k , nit and

to also denote the choices of recovered individuals.

4 Note here that we implicitly assume that infected people will be fully at work. One might alternatively wish to assume
that only a fraction of them are at work instead. Given our assumptions about excluding infections in the work place, this
does not a↵ect the infection rate via that channel. However, lowering the amount of income of infected people lowers their
consumption and thus lowers their ability to infect others in the consumption market. We do not wish to emphasize this
channel, though: in a somewhat richer model, people will have a bu↵er stock of savings, and an infected person would then
draw on these savings to finance consumption rather than respond to the temporary decline in labor income. Alternatively,
income may fall considerably less in practice than the model would otherwise imply here, due to various social insurance
policies.

Equilibrium Characterization

In equilibrium, each individual solves her or his maximization problem, and the labor and goods market
has to clear in every period. Let ntk be total labor employed in sector k. The market clearing conditions

3.1

Theoretical Results
Two extremes

It is instructive to consider extreme values for the elasticity of substitution ⌘. The first extreme is an
elasticity of substitution of zero such that the consumption aggregator is of the Leontie↵ form.
Proposition 1. Suppose that ⌘ = 0, i.e. that the consumption aggregation in (1) is Leontie↵. In that
case, the multisector economy is equivalent to a multisector economy with a -function, which is constant
and equal to 1,
Proof. With Leontie↵ consumption aggregation, consumption is sector independent, cjtk ⌘ cjt . Equations
(4) and (5) now become

⌧ t = ⇡s I t

Z

(k)cst cit dk = ⇡s It cst cit

Z

(k)dk = ⇡s It cst cit

(25)

and

T t = ⇡s S t I t

Z

(k)cstk citk dk = ⇡s St It cst cit

(26)

10

Equations (25) and (26) furthermore show, that the Leontie↵ version is equivalent to the one-sector
economy in ERT.
The other extreme is the case where goods are perfect substitutes.
Proposition 2. Suppose that ⌘ ! 1, i.e. that the sector-level consumption goods in (1) are perfect
substitutes in the limit, Let k = supk {k | (k) = (0)}. Assume that k > 0, i.e. that there is a nonzero
mass of sectors with the lowest level of infection interaction. Suppose that I0 > 0. Then there is a limit
consumption cjtk for j 2 {s, i, r} as ⌘ ! 1, satisfying

cstk =

Equations (4) and (5) are replaced by
⌧t = ⇡s (0)It cst cit

(29)

Tt = ⇡s (0)St It cst cit

(30)

and

That is, susceptible individuals only consume in the lowest infection-prone sectors with (k) = (0),
and infected (as well as recovered) individuals consume uniformly across all sectors.
Proof. Equation (28) is just equation (20), which also holds for recovered agents: it will therefore also
hold, when taking5 the limit ⌘ ! 1. Equation (27) follows from (14) together with (1), taking ⌘ ! 1.
Define the consumption distribution of type j 2 {s, i, r} as jt (k) = cjtk /cjt and note that
Z

jt (k)dk = 1

(31)

and that
jt (k)

0, all k

(32)

5 Note that it does not necessarily hold at the limit, as infected and recovered agents there are indi↵erent as to which
goods to consume

Rewrite (4) and (5) as
⌧t = ⇡s It cst cit

Z

(k)st (k)it (k)dk

(33)

Therefore and analogously to ERT, the total number of newly infected people is given by

T t = ⇡s S t I t

Z

(k)st (k)it (k)dk

(34)

Equations (29) and (30) now follow from observing that it (k) ⌘ 1 and st (k) = 1/k for k 2 [0, k] and
zero elsewhere as well as noting that (k) = (0) for k 2 [0, k].
Equations (29) and (30) also show, that the limit is equivalent to the one-sector economy in ERT,
with ⇡s replaced by ⇡s (0). Infection only takes place in the sector with lowest infection hazard, thus
introducing the extra factor

(0). The size of the sector, however, does not enter. With a smaller

size of that sector and with equal distribution of infected agents across all sectors, susceptible agents
meet a smaller fraction of infected agents in that sector on the one hand, a mitigating force. On the
other hand, the consumption activity of susceptible agents in these sectors rises, an enhancing force.
These two exactly cancel. Given that the size of the sector with lowest infection hazard does not matter
at both extreme ends given in propositions 1 and 2, one might conjecture that it is never relevant.
However, numerical simulations indicate, that larger rates of infection occur if that sector is smaller, for
substitution elasticies 0 < ⌘ < 1.
Proposition 2 above exploits the fact that infected agents wish to spread their consumption equally
across all sectors for any finite value of ⌘. At the limit ⌘ = 1, infected agents are entirely indi↵erent,
though. At the one extreme, they might consume rather large portions of the low-k goods. At the other
extreme, they stick to each other in the high-infection-risk segments, and not consume the low-k-goods
at all. In that latter case, the infection probabilities become zero and the spread of the disease is stopped
entirely. The following proposition provides the resulting range for the infection probabilities.
Proposition 3. Suppose that ⌘ = 1, i.e. that the sector-level consumption goods in (1) are perfect
substitutes. Let µt be any function of time satisfying

0  µt  µ̄
where µ̄ is defined as

µ̄ = R

1

(35)

and note that it satisfies

(36)

Then there is an equilibrium with equations (4) and (5) replaced by
⌧t = ⇡s µt It cst cit

(37)

Tt = ⇡s µt St It cst cit

(38)

and

Proof. We first show (36). For the lower bound, note that

The upper bound follows from Jensen’s inequality and (3). We next shall show, that there is an equilibrium, when µt equals one of the two bounds. Given the consumption distribution function it , note that
the problem of the susceptible agents is to choose their own consumption distribution function st so as
to minimize (33), subject to the constraints (31) and (32). The Kuhn-Tucker first order condition imply
that st (k) = 0, unless
k 2 {k | (k)it (k) = min (k)it (k)}
For µt = 0, let infected agents consume zero, it (k) = 0 for all k in some subset K of [0, 1]. In that case
and per the argument just provided, susceptible people choose st (k) > 0 only if k 2 K. Conversely, the
worst case scenario in terms of infection arises, if (k)it (k) is constant. Given (31), this yields
it (k) =

µ̄
(k)

(39)

Given this it function, susceptible agents are now indi↵erent in their consumption choice. Any st
function satisfying (31) and (32) then results in
Z

st (k)it (k)dk = µ̄

and thus (37) and (38) at µt = µ̄, i.e. the upper bound. Finally, let 0 < µt < µ̄ and let

13

= µt /µ̄. Let K

be a measurable subset of [0, 1] with mass strictly between 0 and 1. Set

it (k) =

: ˜

µ̄
(k) ,

for k 2 K

µ̄
(k) ,

for k 2 [0, 1]\K

where ˜ is chosen such that (31) holds. Then, susceptible agents will choose st (k) = 0 for all k 2 [0, 1]\K,
are indi↵erent between k 2 K, and (37) and (38) hold true for the chosen µt .
The proposition shows, that the perfect substitutability might be nearly as bad as the Leontie↵
case, if infected people behave particularly badly and distribute their consumption according to (39).
Equations (37) and (38) are then the same equations as in the ERT model with ⇡s replaced by ⇡s µ̄. On
the other hand, perfect substitutability can also result in the most benign scenario of a zero spread of
consumption, if infected and susceptible people simply consume di↵erent goods.
There are fascinating policy lessons in here. Given that infected people will end up seeking services
and consumption, it might be best to encourage them to seek out those types, where the degree of
interaction is high, rather than forcing all agents, including the infected agents, into the low infection
transmission segments. The model here shows that this can have dramatic consequences for the spread
of the disease.

3.2

Infections in the Labor Market

Thus far we have assumed that infections can take place when acquiring consumption goods. We could
have similarly allowed for heterogeneity in labor and assumed that it is at work in the labor market where
individuals face the risk of contracting the virus. We explore this possibility in this section, o↵ering two
alternative approaches, and shall show that the formal analysis is conceptually similar and, for the first
approach, actually equivalent to the model analyzed above. In economic terms and interpretation, the
key distinction is arguably less in the formal di↵erences between both versions of the model, but rather
in the empirically plausible choice for the elasticity of substitution ⌘: while it may be possible to easily
substitute between di↵erent types of similar consumption goods (“Pizza at home” versus “Pizza in a
restaurant”), the same may not be true for work (restaurants will still have to produce the to-be-delivered
pizza in the restaurant kitchen, rather than having their workers stay at home and produce in their own
kitchens). Our results for the lower elasticity of substitution ⌘ = 3 may thus be more appropriate for the
analysis of infection-at-the-work-place. In the extreme without substitution possibilities, we are back at
the homogeneous sector case.

but now assume that consumption c is a homogeneous good, while household labor n is a composite of

assume that labor supplied by the household to the market is a CES composite of sector-specific labor,

In Appendix C we establish the following result.
Proposition 4. Suppose that ⇡
˜s = A2 ⇡s and that ↵ = ⌘. In that case, the production-based labor aggregation with infection in the labor market is equivalent to the consumption-infection economy described
above, i.e. all aggregates remain the same, while nstk /nst = cstk /cst , when comparing the ratio of sectorspecific labor to the labor aggregate in the labor-market-infection economy to the ratio of sector-specific
constumption to the consumption aggregate in the consumption-infection economy.
For this formal equivalence, it is important that the aggregation (41) takes place at the household level
and not at the firm level, i.e. in firms hiring labor from di↵erent households. The latter would provide
an interesting alternative environment for studying the sectoral shift issues raised here, but requires
additional restrictions to preclude complete separation of infected and susceptible agents in equilibrium.
The household-level labor aggregation described above may be be hard to envision as an environment
for sector-specific contagion risk. We therefore o↵er a second, preference-based approach. For that, think
of the household as composed of individual workers, each specialized to work in sector k, and that total
household leisure, described by ` = f (n) for some strictly decreasing and di↵erentiable function6 f is a

consumption sector economy, although its analysis it is not exactly equivalent. In Appendix C we demonstrate this more formally. The remarks here are simply meant to show that the mechanisms in both types
of labor-infection-based models are rather similar to our baseline consumption-based-infection economy
indeed. We therefore skip a full quantitative analysis and do not to integrate this feature into the ensuing
analysis.

Social Planning Problem

It is instructive to compare our results to that of a social planner with the ability to test individuals,
i.e. with full knowledge of who is susceptible, infected or recovered. However, in the same way the
agents in our model the planner cannot separate the infected from the susceptible (and recovered), when
they consume (that is, the planner cannot change the consumption technology). Therefore, as in the
decentralized economy, the spread of the disease while consuming can at best be mitigated by allocating
consumers to low-infectious sectors. The social planner maximizes date-0 aggregate social welfare W0 ,
where

5.1

Computational Strategy

The unknowns to be carried around (aside from the sector-specific consumption): Uts , cst , nst ,

s
bt , ⌫t , ⌧t .

The equations determining these variables are the Bellman equation (11), the budget constraint (2), the
infection constraint (B.8), the share constraint (B.5) replacing the original first order condition with
respect to consumption, the first order condition with respect to labor (16) and the first order condition
with respect to ⌧ (15) combined with (14). One can easily eliminate

bt

and nst , using (2) and (16),

as well as eliminate ⌫t with (14) and (15): what remains then is a system in three unknowns Uts , cst , ⌧t
and three equations, two of which are nonlinear integral equations, that would need to be solved. The
s
way to proceed is from a distant horizon, and working backwards. Knowing Ut+1
allows one to compute

⌫t with (14) and (15). Using the two integral equations (having substituted out

s
bt

and nst ) allows

one to compute cst and ⌧t . From there compute nt with (2) and Uts . We use Dynare to perform these
calculations.

5.2

Parameterization

We choose parameters much in line with Eichenbaum et al. (2020) and summarize them in Table 1.
Given that our infection interaction only takes place in the consumption sector, we choose ⇡s so that we
obtain their 10-percent decline in consumption in a homogeneous-sector economy, see Fig. 1. We mostly
investigate a two-sector economy, where both sectors are of equal size, and sector 1 has infection intensity

satisfying 0 < (k) =

for k 2 (0.5, 1]. We pick

= 0.2 for our benchmark

= 1.8. We set ⌘ = 10 as well as, alternatively, ⌘ = 3. We also investigate higher

values for ⌘, in order to compare to the limit case discussed in Proposition 2.
In contrast to ERT, we shut down the autonomous infection possibility ⇡a for our benchmark calculations, resulting in a considerably lower number of ultimately recovered agents and a lower peak of
infected agents, compared to their results. For comparison and robustness, we also provide a version of
our main results, when allowing for autonomous infection possibility ⇡a , with parameters set so that the
consumption decline in the homogeneous sector case remains at 10 percent at its bottom, but targeting
a ratio of around 50 percent for the share of recovered people in the long run, as in their results.

Results

We now present our results, starting in Section 6.1 with the findings for our benchmark economy with two
sectors and contrasting them to the representative sector economy of ERT. We then explore, in Section
6.2 the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of more than two sectors, as well as the possibility
that some infections occur through non-economic interactions. Finally, we contrast the findings from the
decentralized economy with the allocations chosen by a social planner in Section 6.3.

6.1

Results for the Benchmark Economy

Our simulations show that a heterogeneous-sector economy delivers a lower infection rate, as compared to
a homogeneous-sector economy. Fig. 1 contains a comparison of the homogeneous-sector case

⌘ 1 as in

ERT (the doted black line) with our heterogeneous-sector case for our baseline elasticity of substitution
⌘ = 10 (solid blue line) as well as the alternative value ⌘ = 3 (dashed green line). In the event of a virus
outbreak, susceptible households are able to substitute consumption goods from the high-infection sector
with goods from the low-infection sector, while maintaining a relatively stable consumption path. Such a
behaviour lowers the risk of being infected from participating in high-infection activities. As a result, the
infection rate is only a fraction of that in a homogeneous-sector economy. Both the consumption decline
and the number of deaths are considerably mitigated. For our baseline parameterization of ⌘ = 10,
consumption declines by no more than 2 percent, and even for ⌘ = 3, the consumption decline is a more
modest 4 percent rather than 10 percent, at its steepest point. The results are actually stronger in
terms of measured consumption rather than the consumption composite shown in the second panel at
the bottom. From the resource constraint, measured consumption is equal to measured labor and thus,
given the production technology, equal to measured output. The decline in labor for ⌘ = 10 is just 1.3%
rather than 10%, i.e. 87% of the measured output loss is avoided due to the substitution of consumption
across sectors. The infection curve is considerably flattened as well, compared to the homogeneous-sector
case.
For the deceased, the left panel of Fig. 9 shows the ratio of the heterogeneous sector scenario to that
of the homogeneous sector case. Around week 50, i.e. around a year after the outbreak, the ratio declines
to less than 20 percent for the ⌘ = 10 heterogeneous-sector scenario, compared to the homogeneous case.
The ratio then starts climbing again and gradually. While we show these results, one probably wants to
take into account that proper testing, vaccination and cures will likely be available two years from now,
if needed. Therefore, the first 100 weeks is probably the truly relevant range of the simulations.
The comparison of ⌘ = 3 to ⌘ = 10 in Fig. 1 shows the importance of the substitution mechanism
between goods: with a higher elasticity of substitution, households are more willing to substitute into

19

Figure 2: Heterogeneous-sector economy: variations in ⌘.
the low-infection-risk sectors. Fig. 2 contains a greater in-depth analysis of the role of ⌘. In cases where
the elasticity of substitution is approaching infinity, i.e. ⌘ = 100 and ⌘ = 1000, the infection curve is
not just flattened, it is reversed: the number of infected people decays on its own. This is consistent
with Proposition 2. When goods from the two sectors are nearly perfectly substitutable, susceptible
households consume exclusively from the low-infection sector, as depicted in Fig. 3.
Fig. 1 already shows that the heterogeneous sector scenario with ⌘ = 10 predicts a considerable
flattening of the infection curve. It does not take much of a parameter change to obtain a reversal of
the infection curve. Fig. 2 has shown this already for higher values of ⌘, but a similar e↵ect holds with
a slightly lower value for the infection parameter ⇡s . In Fig. 4, we decrease the value of ⇡s in the scale
of 10

9

until the number of infected people is lower in period 1 than in period 0. This exercise results

in a ⇡s value of 3.51 ⇥ 10

7

, or 87% of the calibrated value in Table 1. One can see how the number of

infected agents declines on their own at the lower ⇡s value, shown in green dashed lines. Such a lower
value for ⇡s might either reflect our still considerable uncertainty regarding the replication rate of the
Coronavirus infection, or may reflect a modest success of non-economic policy measures, such as social
distancing and enhanced personal hygiene.

Sensitivity Analysis
Varying infection risks

Our choice of

1

= 0.2 implies a much lower risk of infection in the low-infection sector, as compared to

the high-infection sector. In Fig. 5, we show the dynamics of aggregate consumption at varying values of
1,

with

1

= 0.1 representing the largest di↵erence in infection risk between the two sectors. Note that

the average value of

1

and

2

is kept at 1. As the di↵erence in infection risks decreases, the decline in

aggregate consumption is larger. It is also of interest to note that despite the larger decline, the economy
recovers to a higher level in cases of larger
that for smaller value of

1,

1

values, two years after the epidemic. In Fig. 6, we show

the deceased population is only a fraction of that in the homogeneous-sector

scenario.
6.2.2

More than Two Sectors

The model with two sectors is admittedly a stark (albeit transparent) representation of the U.S. economy.
It is therefore of interest to examine the robustness of our findings in an economy with multiple sectors.
Fig. 7 shows the outcome in an economy with nine sectors rather than just two, and the resulting shifts
of economic activities across sectors. Sectors with lower infection, in general, experience an expansion as
susceptible households substitute high-infection goods with low-infection ones. The e↵ect appears to be

22

Figure 6: Dynamics of deceased across

values.

fairly linear rather than “heaping” all of the consumption on the lowest-infection sector. It is not quite
linear, though: note that the distance of the lines increases with decreasing

. Put di↵erently, some

modest “heaping” does take place. Notably, the dynamics of aggregate consumption traces that of the
two-sector economy rather closely.
6.2.3

Autonomous Infections

For Fig. 8, we allow for the possibility of autonomous infections, outside the social consumption or labor
activity, i.e. we allow for ⇡a 6= 0. For comparison with the results in ERT and the homogeneous sector
case, we keep the target of a 10 percent consumption decline for the ERT economy, but now also impose
the target of 50 percent recovered or deceased agents in the long run, see the black dotted line. Imposing
⌘ = 10 now results in a consumption decline of 4 percent rather than the 2 percent calculated above. This
is due to the infection dynamics, which keeps on going: given the autonomously large number of infected
people in the economy, susceptible agents will choose to reduce their consumption more now. Likewise,
the decline in the number of deaths is no longer quite as dramatic. The right panel of Fig. 9 shows the
result: still, slightly more than 50 percent of the deaths (rather than 80 percent in the left panel) are
avoided in the heterogeneous sector economy, compared to the homogeneous sector case, around 1 year
after the outbreak. Given the considerable autonomous nature of the pandemic in this version of the
model, we still view this as a remarkably large number. In any case and as argued in the introduction,
23

Figure 7: Consumption dynamics in a 9-sector economy.
it is hard to think of a source of infection not related to social activity, and it is hard to think of social
activity as not being some form of consumption or work, even if these activities are not accounted for in
the National Income and Product Accounts. For these reasons, we view our results in Fig. 1 as ultimately
more relevant.

6.3

Socially Optimal Allocations

Lastly, we explore the solution to the social planner’s problem described in section 4. Fig. 10 shows the
outcome of the social planner solution (green line) in comparison to our baseline decentralized economy
with ⌘ = 10 (blue line) as well as the homogeneous-sector case (black-dotted line).7 The social planner
essentially stops the outbreak dead in its tracks: the number of infected agents declines quickly, and
is barely noticeable within a few weeks after the start of the outbreak. The social planner achieves
this outcome by restricting consumption of infected agents in a Draconian manner, thereby hugely
mitigating the infection risk and stopping the infection at the onset. Compared to the competitive
equilibrium outcome, a planner with the power to distinguish between the health status of infected
and susceptible therefore is even more successful in averting the epidemic. However, as we saw above,
private incentives together with substitution possibilities across sectors makes the epidemic much more
7 The social planner solution for the homogeneous sector case (not plotted) is practically indistinguishable from the
planner solution for the heterogeneous sector economy: as far as aggregates chosen by a social planner are concerned,
sector heterogeneity plays practically no role.

24

Figure 8: Dynamics with autonomous infection (⇡a 6= 0).

Figure 9: Deceased as percentages of constant- scenario.

25

Figure 10: Heterogeneous-sector economy: social planning solution.
benign already, relative to the one-sector economy studied in most of the literature. Thus, the wedge
between equilibrium and socially optimal allocations is much smaller if private households are given more
opportunity to shift activity away from highly infectious sectors. The additional powers a↵orded to the
social planner are therefore less potent in our economy, relative to a world where private adjustments to
the epidemic are more limited.
Fig. 11 further illustrates how the consumption of infected people is restricted. In the baseline
scenario, the per capita consumption of an infected household is restricted to less than 17% of its steady
state of the non-infectious competitive equilibrium. In particular and due to the high substitutability
between the goods in our baseline case of ⌘ = 10, nearly all the consumption of infected agents takes
place in the low-infection sector. E↵ectively, the planner insulates with large infection risk from infected
individuals. In an alternative case with lower elasticity of substitution, ⌘ = 3, the social planner does not
impose quite as drastic a di↵erence across the sectors (since this would be very costly in terms of lifetime
utility of the infected individuals, which the planner values), and rather lowers the total consumption
of the infected agent to around 20% of the non-infectious steady state. In the homogeneous sector case,
alternatively, the case for ⌘ = 0, consumption in both sectors is the same, as the dotted-black line shows:
now, consumption for the infected is reduced to only 8 percent of the non-infectious steady state. It is
in this treatment of the infected, where the sectoral substitution possibilities matter considerably.

26

Figure 11: Per capita consumption of infected people.
One should take the social planner solution with a grain of salt, of course. Presumably, a really
powerful social planner would entirely separate the infected and recovered people from the susceptible
people. If this is technologically feasible, the disease cannot spread any further, and no consumption
decline for the infected is needed. The formulation of our social planner problem precludes this possibility.
In summary, our calculations and this remark shows that the possibility for containing the pandemic
depends crucially on the tools available to the government, and they may involve imposing considerable
hardship on a few (the initially infected) in order to rescue the many.

Conclusion

Our paper is inspired by the macroeconomics-cum-SIR model of Eichenbaum et al. (2020). We depart
from their analysis in that we permit substitution of consumption across sectors with di↵erent degrees
of infection probabilities. We show that the resulting economic outcome di↵er dramatically as a result.
With homogeneous sectors, we obtain a steep decline of economic activity, fully in line with ERT. If
the substitution mechanism is activated, eighty percent of that decline is mitigated in our benchmark
calibration and in the decentralized economy: the “curve” is flattened substantially, without much prolongation. Pushing the parameters a bit more and thus capturing that people practice additional social

27

distancing and hygiene, we show that infections may decline entirely on their own, simply due to the
re-allocation of economic activity: the curve does not just get flattened, it gets reversed. One may view
our results as the “Swedish” outcome: Sweden has largely avoided government restrictions on economic
activity, allowing people to make their own choices. These private incentives and well-functioning laborand-social-insurance markets, we submit, may solve the COVID19-spread on their own, mitigating the
decline in economic activity.

Details for the Heterogeneous Labor Economy

Proof of Proposition 4. To see the similarities and di↵erences between the heterogeneous consumptionand heterogeneous labor economy more formally, observe that the first order conditions for infected
p
p
and recovered agents are unchanged. In particular, we obtain cit = citk ⌘ A/ ✓ and nit = nitk = 1/ ✓,
regardless as to whether consumption or labor is heterogeneous and regardless of the particular approach
taken for labor heterogeneity. It therefore suffices to examine the first order conditions for susceptible
agents.
For the consumption-infection baseline model, the first-order conditions can be summarized by

Recall that the infection probability is given by equation (4). Substituting out the solution for cit as well
as cstk with Anstk = cstk , it can be restated as

˜s = A2 ⇡s and nstk /nst = cstk /ct , equations (C.5) becomes (C.1), equations (C.6) become
equations (C.2) and (C.8) becomes (C.4).
