The Hammer and the Scalpel: On the Economics of Indiscriminate versus Targeted Isolation

ABSTRACT
We develop a simple dynamic economic model of epidemic transmission designed to be
consistent with widely used SIR biological models of the transmission of epidemics, while
incorporating economic benefits and costs as well. Our main finding is that targeted testing and
isolation policies deliver large welfare gains relative to optimal policies when these tools are not
used. Specifically, we find that when testing and isolation are not used, optimal policy delivers a
welfare gain equivalent to a 0.6% permanent increase in consumption relative to no intervention.
The welfare gain arises because under the optimal policy, the planner engineers a sharp recession
that reduces aggregate output by about 40% for about 3 months. This sharp contraction in
economic activity reduces the rate of transmission and reduces cumulative deaths by about 0.1%.
When testing policies are used, optimal policy delivers a welfare gain equivalent to a 3%
permanent increase in consumption. The associated recession is milder in that aggregate output
declines by about 15% and cumulative deaths are reduced by .3%. Much of this welfare gain
comes from isolating infected individuals. When individuals who are suspected to be infected are
isolated without any testing, optimal policy delivers a welfare gain equivalent to a 2% increase in
permanent consumption.

1. Introduction
Pandemics force households, firms, and governments to make cruel choices between
unhappy alternatives. Much economic activity is enhanced by close person-to-person contact.
Unfortunately, this kind of contact typically allows viruses to be more easily transmitted
from person to person. Much of the economic literature on epidemics studies the tradeoffs between the losses to economic activity associated with limiting contact and the gains
from reduced transmission of the virus, including reduced healthcare costs, lower strains on
hospitals, and fewer deaths. The response to the coronavirus epidemic in most Western
countries has been to limit contacts by limiting economic activity. Some countries—most
notably, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan—have limited economic activity
to a lesser extent and have supplemented the modest limitations with aggressive policies of
targeted testing, contact tracing, and isolation. In this paper, we develop a version of a fairly
standard macroeconomic model of epidemics, incorporate testing and isolation policies into
it, and ask to what extent testing policies of targeted testing and isolation can achieve better
outcomes. In a quantitative version of our model, we find that even a policy of targeted
testing and isolation that is substantially less aggressive than that conducted in South Korea
can yield substantial welfare gains. If testing and isolation policies are optimally designed,
economic activity must be curtailed to a much more limited extent, and the number of deaths
is substantially smaller than if testing and isolation policies are not available. We argue that
relative to no testing, untargeted testing yields only modest benefits. We also argue that,
even if testing resources are not available, targeted isolation without testing yields about
two-thirds of the welfare gains from a targeted testing and isolation policy.
This paper develops a simple dynamic economic model of epidemic transmission. The
model is designed to be consistent with widely used SIR biological models of the transmission
of epidemics (see Atkeson (2020b) for a primer), while incorporating economic benefits and
costs as well. We choose a formulation that makes it possible to analyze the benefits and costs
of various policies. The main stand we take is that social proximity has benefits by allowing for
economic activity to take place. We have in mind that certain types of production activities
require groups of people to work in close proximity to one other. The obvious example of
such an activity is assembly line production. In other activities, individuals derive value from

social proximity in consumption. Examples of such activities are watching live performances
of plays or rock concerts. While substitutes are available for production and consumption with
social proximity (artisanal production as opposed to assembly line production, or televised
rock concerts versus live ones), revealed preference shows that people value social proximity
in many aspects of production and consumption. Social proximity has costs when such
proximity allows viruses to be transmitted relatively easily.
The standard SIR model in epidemiology has three types of agents: susceptible (or not
yet infected) agents, infected agents, and recovered agents (who may be alive or dead). To
allow for testing, we extend the model to allow for two types of infected agents: those known
to be infected and those not known to be infected. In our economic model, agents engage in
a variety of economic activities. Each economic activity is associated with a given number
of “meetings” with other agents. These activities are combined to produce a final output
good. The virus is transmitted with an exogenous activity-specific probability in a meeting
between an infected and susceptible agent. We assume that activities with low transmission
probabilities also have low economic value.
The planner seeks to maximize the present discounted utility of consumption net
of costs of treating infected agents and of death costs. In our model, absent any testing,
the planner excludes agents who are known to be infected from any activity and allocates
some of the agents whose types are not known to the activity with the lowest probability of
transmission. Since the lowest probability of transmission activity has the lowest economic
value, this policy tends to reduce output, but it saves lives. The quantitative version of our
model generates output declines and death reductions broadly similar to those in Eichenbaum
et al. (2020b) and Glover et al. (2020). We measure the welfare gains from optimal policy
as the permanent percentage increase in consumption that would give the planner the same
utility as under no policy. For reference, we note that the loss in welfare in the no-intervention
economy relative to the no-pandemic economy is 6.66%. We show that the optimal policy
yields a welfare gain of roughly .6% relative to no intervention. We then introduce a costly
testing technology. The planner can choose to test a fraction of the population whose types
are not known. We assume the test perfectly reveals whether an agent is infected. We show
that optimal policy with this type of untargeted testing yields a welfare gain of .7% relative
2

to no intervention. That is, untargeted testing delivers gains of only .1% relative to welfare
under optimal policy with no testing.
We allow for targeted testing by assuming that each agent whose type is not known is
associated with a signal that he is infected. We think of this signal as combining information
from a variety of sources. One example is contact tracing, which involves tracing people an
infected person has come into contact with, persons whom these contacts contacted, and so
on. This signal is informative in the sense that the probability of receiving the signal is higher
for infected agents than for susceptible agents. We assume the signal is not perfectly revealing
in that the probability an infected person receives the signal is strictly less than one. Out of
these agents with the signal, the planner chooses the fraction to test. We choose the signal
probabilities to be consistent with data from South Korea. That data suggests that 38%
of infected people and 0.44% of susceptible people are associated with the signal. We show
that the welfare gain from optimal policy with targeted testing relative to no intervention is
roughly 3% of consumption forever. That is, targeted testing allows for a dramatic gain in
welfare relative to a no-intervention policy.
In our model, targeted testing allows the planner to very precisely target some agents
in order to isolate them. We separate out the effects of isolation from the informational
gains to testing by considering a version of the model in which the planner cannot test after
receiving the signal.1 The planner simply chooses the fraction of individuals with a signal
to isolate. We show that under optimal isolation, the welfare gains are 2% of consumption
forever. That is, roughly 2/3 of the gains from optimal testing can be realized by forgoing
testing and simply isolating agents suspected of being infected.
We conduct a variety of sensitivity exercises by varying the probability of receiving the
signal. We show that if 60% of infected agents and 3% of susceptible agents are associated
with the signal, the welfare gains relative to no intervention are about 5.5%. That is, the
welfare loss from the pandemic is only about 1% of consumption. We also show that if a
relatively small fraction of infected agents receives the signal, then the welfare gains are also
smaller.

Testing can, of course, be very valuable in learning about the current state of the system and the
parameters governing its evolution. Our focus here is on testing to isolate infected individuals, rather than
testing as a learning device.

These findings provide additional quantitative support for the policies advocated by
Romer and Garber (2020), Romer (2020), and Holtemöller (2020).
Relation to other recent papers.
Here, we present a discrete-time version of the standard continuous-time SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) epidemiology model outlined (for economists) by Atkeson (2020b).2
A long (and growing) list of papers emphasizes the trade-offs between the losses from restrictions on economic activity and the losses from allowing the virus to spread. See, among
many others, Alvarez et al. (2020), Atkeson (2020b), Atkeson (2020a), Azzimonti et al. (2020),
Baqaee et al. (2020), Bodenstein et al. (2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2020b), Farboodi et al.
(2020), Garriga et al. (2020), Guerrieri et al. (2020), Hall et al. (2020), Jones et al. (2020),
Kaplan et al. (2020), Krueger et al. (2020), Moser and Yared (2020), Rampini (2020), and
Toxvaerd (2020). While none of these papers focuses on the role of testing, some other recent
papers do. See, for example, Eichenbaum et al. (2020a), Berger et al. (2020), Acemoglu et al.
(2020), and Piguillem et al. (2020). Our findings complement the results in this literature
regarding the desirability of testing. In particular, Eichenbaum et al. (2020a) and Piguillem
et al. (2020) also emphasize the critical role of isolation.

2. An Economic Model with SIR Contagion
Consider a discrete time infinite horizon model with a continuum of individuals on the
unit interval. At any date, an individual is either susceptible S, infected I (and thus contagious), or recovered R, (where recovered can be either dead or alive). Of the infected, I − I˜
agents are known to be infected, and I˜ agents are not known to be infected (hereafter unknown infected ). Let (St , It , I˜t , Rt ) denote the fraction of agents who are susceptible, infected,
unknown infected, and recovered (dead or alive) at date t. We assume that the planner knows
which agents are recovered and which are known to be infected, but the planner cannot tell
apart susceptible and unknown infected agents.
An infected person dies with probability γδ, stays alive with probability γ(1 − δ),
and stays infected with probability (1 − γ). We assume, as is conventional in much of the
2

Atkeson (2020b), like other models in epidemiology, allows also for an Exposed state. Such models are
referred to as SEIR models.

4

literature, that infection confers permanent immunity so that a recovered person always stays
recovered—again, either dead or alive. If S0 + I0 = 1 (all individuals start as susceptible or
infected), this assumption ensures that, for all t, (1 − δ)Rt fraction of initially alive people
are alive and δRt fraction of initially alive people are dead.
In our model, economic activity is associated with meetings or interactions. Our
economy has N types of intermediate goods labeled i ∈ {1, . . . , N }. Good i is produced using
activity i. Each activity of type i requires Mi meetings for each person engaged in that
activity. The technology for producing good i is given by
(1)

yit = bi L̄it ,

where yit is the amount of good i, bi is a technology parameter that depends on activity i and
the number of meetings, and L̄it is the amount of effective labor allocated to good i. Type S
and type R agents each supply one unit of effective labor, and infected agents supply ξ units
of effective labor. The intermediate goods are combined into a final consumption good by a
CES aggregator, so that the amount of the final good Yt produced in period t is
(2)

Yt =

In the presence of a pandemic, meetings also lead to type-specific transmission of
the virus. The purpose of indexing meetings by type i and allowing the transmission rate
to depend on meeting type i is to allow the framework to consider multiple types of policy
interventions, such as prohibiting or decreasing particular types of meetings. For instance, the
probability of transmission while chatting on a sidewalk can depend on whether both people
are wearing masks. Meeting while wearing masks can be considered a different type of meeting
than meeting while not wearing masks. Meetings that occur only after each participant has
had his temperature checked can be considered a different type of meeting from meetings
where such temperature checks do not occur. Further, we later consider the costs of various
policy interventions. While the rate of transmission for two workers standing next to each
other might be the same regardless of what they are producing, the cost to society of reducing
such meetings may very well depend on whether they are producing ventilators or academic
5

papers (since the latter can be more easily moved online). In such a case, these two activities
would be considered different types of meetings.
Model with No Testing
To make the exposition easier, we begin by considering a version of the model with no
testing and then introduce testing. In our model, economic activity induces infections and
thereby the resulting laws of motion for the state variables. Let Lit denote the mass of people
assigned to activity i, λit denote the fraction of agents assigned to activity i whose types are
unknown (these consist of S and I˜ type agents), and µit the fraction of recovered agents who
are assigned to activity i. We assume that agents who are known to be infected are assigned to
activity N . Each activity i is characterized by the probability that a susceptible person who
meets an infected person gets infected, pi . Within an activity, meetings are independently
drawn. Since the mass of people assigned to activity i is Lit , and the mass of infected people
assigned to activity i is λit I˜t , a susceptible person in a single meeting meets an infected person
with probability λit I˜t /Lit and gets infected with probability pi λit I˜t /Lit . The probability of
being infected in Mi meetings is then

and the law of motion for R is
(8)

Rt+1 = Rt + γ (1 − St − Rt ) .

Together with the adding up constraint that is St + It + Rt = 1, the system of equations, (5),
(7), and (8) describe the dynamics of the system. This dynamical system has a continuum of
steady states, indexed by S, the steady state fraction of susceptible individuals, with R, the
steady state fraction of recovered individuals equal to 1−S (and thus I = 0). For expositional
convenience, we describe the problem the planner solves below.
Given an initial state of the system (I˜0 , R0 , S0 ) and the policy variables λit and µit ,
the approximate dynamical system, with (5) replaced by (6), is identical to the familiar
SIR models from epidemiology. A key variable in these models is R0,t — the number of
new infections per susceptible person per infected person, multiplied by the mean number
of periods an infected person is infected. (The variable R0,t is not to be confused with Rt ,
the fraction of recovered people in the population.) From equation (6), using the observation

Model with Testing
Next, we introduce testing into the model. At the beginning of each period, each
person whose type is not known is associated with a public signal that he is infected. Let θX ,
˜ denote the probability this signal is received regarding an individual of type X.
X ∈ {S, I}
That is, the signal is useful information to the extent that θI > θS . With this formulation, the
mass of agents who are associated with a signal of infection is θS S + θI I. The planner chooses
to test the fraction τ of these individuals. We assume the test perfectly reveals whether an
agent is infected. The planner then isolates all those who test positive. Thus, the law of
motion for I˜ is now

and output in activity i is given by

(12) yit = bi L̄it = bi λit (St + (1 − τ θI ) ξ I˜t ) + µit Rt .
The cost of testing is C(τ t (θS St + θI It )), where C(·) is the testing cost function. The role
of testing is to remove some of the infected agents whose type is not known from current
and future economic activity until they recover. This policy of removing some of the infected
agents prevents them from infecting others, in both current and future periods. In addition to
the testing cost, removing these agents is costly since they cannot engage in useful economic
activity.
Aggregate consumption is given by Yt − C(τ t (θS St + θI It )). The planner’s preferences
8

over consumption are given by

β t U (Yt − C(τ t (θS St + θI It )). In addition, infection is

associated with a utility cost ZIt , where Z denotes the healthcare and related costs of being
infected, and deaths are associated with a utility cost DγδIt , where we note that the mass of
agents who die in period t is γδIt , and the parameter D measures the cost of a life.

subject to (1), (2), (4), (6), (8), (10), given the initial conditions (S0 , I0 , I˜0 , R0 ). We
will refer to the version of the model with θI = θS = 1 as the model with untargeted testing
and the model with θI > θS as the model with targeted testing. Note that the programming
problem for the model without testing is simply this programming problem with τ t = 0 for
all t.
In order to understand how policy can be used to affect the course of the infection,
consider a simple version of the model with two activities, work and home. Suppose that work
produces higher output but is also associated with higher infection than the home activity,
so that bwork > bhome = 0 and π work > π home = 0. Without any testing, it is optimal in
general to assign some agents whose types are not known to stay home. This policy reduces
economic activity but also reduces the rate of transmission of the virus. We refer to this
policy as indiscriminate isolation, since the policy does not discriminate between infected
and susceptible agents. Consider next the role of targeted testing in this simple model.
Targeted testing allows the planner to isolate some of the infected agents by requiring them
to stay at home. In this sense, targeted testing allows for a form of targeted isolation.
Model with Isolation and No Testing
As before, agents receive signals at the beginning of the period. In this version of the
model, however, the planner does not test but simply isolates some fraction of the agents
who have received signals in the current period. In particular, we assume that the planner
does not use past signals in isolating individuals. This assumption implies that welfare under

9

the policy is a lower bound for a more elaborate policy that uses the entire history of past
signals. The law of motion for I˜ is now

(15) yit = bi Mi λit (1 − τ θS ) St + (1 − τ θI ) ξ I˜t + µit Rt .
Note that as in the case with testing, the role of isolation is to remove some fraction of the
infected people from economic activities where these people may infect others. One advantage
of this policy is that it does not require the use of testing resources. A disadvantage of this
policy is that some fraction of susceptible people is also removed from productive economic
activities. Throughout our analysis of isolation policies we will assume that θI > θS .
Since it is always possible to set τ = 0 with either testing or isolation, it immediately
follows that welfare is higher than it is when these instruments are not available. In our next
result, we show that isolation and testing are policies that are typically used in their entirety
before the planner resorts to reducing labor allocation in productive economic activities with
high rates of infection. In order to understand this result, it is useful to consider a special
case with only two activities: work and home. Suppose that bwork = 1, bhome = 0, π work >
0, π home = 0. In this case, absent a pandemic, all agents would be assigned to the work
activity. With a pandemic and no testing or isolation, it can be optimal to assign some of
the workers of unknown type to stay at home. The trade-off of this policy is that assigning
a larger number of agents to stay home reduces output but also reduces the rate at which
the virus spreads. If only isolation policies are available, then it is possible to show that it
is optimal to exhaust all isolation possibilities before assigning any workers of unknown type
to stay home. We formalize this result in the following proposition.
10

˜ λwork < 1
Proposition 1. Suppose that π home = 0, bhome = 0 and ξ = 1. Then if S > I,
only if τ = 1.
The proof of this result is in the appendix. This result also implies that if the cost of
testing is sufficiently small, it is optimal to exhaust all testing possibilities. By continuity it
follows also that if π home and bhome are not too different from zero, the same result applies.
In summary, these results imply that in general, welfare under a regime with testing
or isolation will be higher than welfare under a regime with no testing or no isolation.
Returns to Testing: A Simple Example
To illustrate the sense in which the gains from targeted testing are potentially large,
consider the following simple example. Suppose there are two activities, home and work,
and bhome = 0. Suppose also that the transmission rate of the virus at home is zero. For
simplicity, assume that the utility function is linear. A planner who desires to reduce R0
from its unrestricted value of 2.5 to a value of 1 can do so by setting λwork = 0.4. Note here
bwork λwork is GDP per time period. If a time period is two weeks, the cost of this policy is
0.6 × $800B = $480B per two-week period.
If one could identify 60% of the infected agents and assign them all to stay at home,
then R0 drops from 2.5 to 1 without reducing GDP very much. One method to do this would
be to test 60% of the population every week, if possible, and require those who test positive
to stay home. It is straightforward to show that this indiscriminate method has a break-even
cost of $1200 per test. If we could instead achieve the same 60% reduction in the number of
infected people in the workplace by testing z × 0.6 fraction of population (contact tracing,
testing targeted in areas of outbreaks), the break-even cost becomes $1200/z.

3. Dynamics and the Effects of Social Distancing
In this section, in order to obtain intuition about the trade-offs that optimal policy
must confront, we illustrate the behavior of our dynamical system for some simple cases.
Suppose now that the fraction of agents who are known to be infected relative to the mass of
˜
infected agents is constant. Let this fraction be denoted by q = 1 − I/I.
Suppose also that
λit = µit = 1/N for all t. Then, it is easy to show that the law of motion for the mass of

11

infected agents is given by

In Figure 1, we display the evolution of this dynamical system in state space form,
with It on the y-axis and St on the x-axis. Note that equation (17) implies that if It > 0,
St+1 − St < 0. That is, S moves to the left, or west, in Figure 1. To see how It evolves,
we partition (S, I) space into those points to the right and left of the upsloping locus of
(S, I) points such that I is constant. We derive this locus by setting It+1 = It = I, St = S,

as indicated in the figure. To the right of this locus, the dynamics of the system are northwest. That is, St+1 < St from (17) and I > 0, and It+1 > It from S being greater than that
associated with I being constant (and It+1 being an increasing function of St in (16)). To the
left of this locus, the dynamics of the system are south-west. Here, again, St+1 < St when
It > 0, and It+1 < It from S being less than that associated with I being constant.
This implies that if the initial (S0 , I0 ) is to the left of the locus, (St , It ) converges to
a steady state on the horizontal axis following a south-west path. If the initial (S0 , I0 ) is
to the right of the locus, (St , It ) converges to a steady state on the horizontal following an
arc-pattern, with It increasing as St decreases until (St , It ) crosses the locus, converging again

to a steady state on the horizontal axis. Note that this implies all steady states reachable
from an initial state with I0 > 0 have S < 1/R0 . That is, assuming I0 > 0, regardless of
the initial state, the system converges to a steady state where, at most, 1/R0 agents avoid
infection. In particular, as R0 → ∞, the fraction of individuals who never get infected goes
to zero (and the fraction of individuals who eventually become infected goes to one). Figure
2 presents some computed examples of (St , It ) paths starting from (S0 , I0 ) = (0.999, 0.001)
with only two activities, home and work, and under the assumption that phome = 0, q = 0,
γ = 1/18, and M ∈ {25γ, 16.6667γ, 12.5γ, 10γ}, pwork is chosen so that the corresponding
R0 ∈ {2.5, 1.67, 1.25, 1.0}. Here, we show the effect of reducing R0 by decreasing M from
a high of M = 25γ (implying R0 = 2.5, or approximately what epidemiologists consider
R0 to be without social distancing) to a low of M = 10γ (implying R0 = 1). For the high
M = 25γ, I increases very quickly, and in a short number of periods, almost all people have
recovered, or (S, I) ≈ (0.1, 0). For the low M = 10γ, I and S decrease slowly, and the system
approaches a steady state with nearly all people having never been infected.

4. Lifting a Lockdown
The previous example gives rise to the sobering possibility that a lockdown must go on
forever, otherwise the system returns to one where R0 is high and I0 > 0, although S0 < 1.
The following example starts with (S0 , I0 ) = (0.999, 0.001) and has M = 10γ (and thus
R0 = 1) for 365 periods (or one year, assuming a one day period length), then permanently
relaxes the lockdown to M = 25γ (and R0 = 2.5). Here, the path after lifting the lockdown
is essentially the same as if the lockdown had never been enforced. Figure 3 shows the result
of this exercise in (S, I) space, and Figure 4 graphs the same exercise showing the infection
rate, It , over time.

5. Calibration
We assume that the utility function U is the log function. We parameterize the testing
cost function as c(T )1+ν /(1 + ν). We assume that the economy has two activities: work and
15

home. This formulation allows us to relate our results to those in the literature, particularly
Eichenbaum et al. (2020b) and Glover et al. (2020).
We set the parameter values to be very similar to equivalent parameter values in
Eichenbaum et al. (2020b) and Glover et al. (2020). The parameter values are reported in
Table 1. We set the time period to be one week and set the discount factor β assuming that
the vaccine is expected to arrive in 18 months and the annualized discount rate for the planner
is 4%. We set the exit rate γ assuming that the expected length of infection of recovery is 18
days. We set the exogenous rate at which unknown infected people become known, τ̃ , using
the observation that infected agents are asymptomatic for the first five days of the infection
and roughly half of all infected agents never display symptoms (see Glover et al. (2020)). We
set the productivity of infected people ξ, following Eichenbaum et al. (2020b). The mortality
rate δ is set at 0.5%; see Ferguson et al. (2020). We set the elasticity of substitution at 2 and
normalize the productivity in the work sector to be 1 and that in the home sector be 0.1. We
set the curvature parameter on the testing cost function, ν, at 1 and choose the parameter c
so that the marginal cost of testing is $50 if 1% of the population is tested. We follow Glover
et al. (2020) in setting the cost of treating the infected, Z, so that the cost of treating an
infected person is $7500 over the course of infection. We set the cost of death parameter, D,
so that the value of a life is equal to the present discounted value of 15 years of consumption.
We set π home = 0.01 and set π work so that the reproduction rate R0 without any policy has
an average value of approximately 3 in the first four weeks.
Since the main focus of our analysis is the role of testing and isolation, we experimented
with a number of values for the signal probabilities, θS and θI . For our baseline calibration,
we set θI = 0.38 and θS = 0.0044. To arrive at these numbers, we start with the view that
South Korea was particularly effective at pursuing an aggressive test, trace, and isolate policy.
In South Korea, about 1.8% of tests return a positive result, compared with a population
infection rate of 0.021%. That is, conditional on having a reason to be tested (a signal in
our model), a South Korean had a probability of testing 86 times higher than if tests were
done randomly. Thus, the South Korean data suggest a value of θI /θS = 86, implying a very
informative signal. In the South Korean data, 1.2% of the population has been tested. Since

6. Findings
Here, we report on the findings from our quantitative model. Our measure of welfare
is the standard compensating variation in consumption widely used in the macroeconomics
literature. Specifically, we ask what permanent percentage increase in consumption relative to
the no-intervention economy would give the planner the same utility as under our experiments.
We report all welfare calculations relative to the no-intervention economy. For reference, we
note that the loss in welfare in the no-intervention economy relative to the no-pandemic
economy is 6.66%. The welfare changes in our experiments relative to the no-policy case
arise from changes in the time paths of output, testing costs, infection costs, and death costs.
In Table 2, we report on the welfare measure in our experiments as well as a partial

17

decomposition of the change in welfare induced by changes in output and death costs. To
measure the change in welfare induced by the changes in output, we compute the annuity
value of the present discounted value of output in our experiments. To measure the changes
in welfare induced by death, we report the cumulative fraction of the population that dies
at the end of 52 weeks. In Figures 5, 6, and 7, we report on the time paths of the fraction
of the population infected It , the fraction of population susceptible St , cumulative deaths,
the reproduction rate R0t , the fraction of the population infected but not known to be so I˜t ,
consumption, the mass tested, and the marginal cost of testing.
We begin by comparing outcomes in the no-policy case, optimal policy with no testing,
and optimal policy with untargeted testing. We see that optimal policy with no testing
yields a welfare gain of roughly 0.6%, and an optimal policy with untargeted testing yields
a welfare gain of 0.7% relative to no intervention. That is, untargeted testing delivers very
modest welfare gains. From Figure 5, we see that in all 3 cases, the economy goes through a
severe recession that lasts about 3 months. We see that optimal policy reduces output at its
trough by roughly 40% and by about 20% with no policy intervention. The primary gains to
welfare relative to no policy come from a sharp reduction in the cumulative number of deaths.
With no policy intervention, roughly 0.5% of the population dies, while with optimal policy,
roughly 0.35% of the population dies. In all three experiments, the population eventually
reaches herd immunity, though the steady state fractions are very different with and without
optimal policy. The figure also shows that the main mechanism by which optimal policy
reduces the cumulative death rate is by inducing a sharper recession, which in turn reduces
the effective reproduction rate R0t below 1 and thereby induces a reduction in the proportion
of the population that is infected. The findings regarding optimal policy with no testing are
broadly similar to the findings in Eichenbaum et al. (2020b) and Glover et al. (2020). Figure
5 also shows that with untargeted testing, as much as 15% of the population is tested. Note
that at its peak, the marginal cost of testing is roughly $800. In this sense, a relatively small
fraction of aggregate resources is allocated to testing. The main reason is that untargeted
testing is not very valuable.
Next, we compare outcomes in our benchmark targeted testing model with outcomes
under optimal policy with no testing and untargeted testing. Table 2 shows that the welfare
18

gains to targeted testing are substantial. In particular, welfare rises by 2.5% relative to
optimal policy with no testing and 3% relative to no policy. This table also shows that the
cumulative deaths are about 0.15% lower once we allow for targeted testing and that the
output loss is moderated by about 0.8% relative to no testing. Figure 6 shows that welfare
rises dramatically mainly because a targeted testing policy ensures an initial decline in the
effective reproduction rate R0t and then keeps that rate at around 1. This way of controlling
the reproduction rate ensures that the cumulative death rate is substantially lower. Figure 6
shows that even at the peak of targeted testing, only about 1.5% of the population is tested.
The marginal cost of testing, even at its peak, is only about $70. These results show that
relative to untargeted testing, targeted testing is both inexpensive and immensely valuable.
Next, we compare outcomes under our benchmark targeted testing model with our
benchmark targeted isolation model. We see that targeted isolation alone generates roughly
two-thirds of the welfare gains that come from targeted testing. In this sense, targeted
isolation is a very valuable tool if testing is not available.
We also conduct sensitivity analyses to the values of our signal probabilities. Table
3 shows that if θI = 0.6, then welfare rises by about 5.7% relative to the no-policy case.
Recalling that the pandemic with no policy delivers a welfare loss of 6.7%, we see that if the
technology for tracking infected individuals is sufficiently effective, the welfare loss from the
pandemic is only about 1%. For this parameter value we also see that the cumulative deaths
are reduced very significantly to 0.04% from 0.35%. Figure 7 also shows that the recession
that arises from the pandemic is mild. Table 3 also shows that if the technology for tracking
infected individuals is much less effective than our benchmark case (θI = 0.15), then the
welfare, output, and death gains are modest relative to no targeted testing. The message of
these findings is that the returns to improving the technology for tracking infected individuals
can be exceptionally large.
Finally, we conduct sensitivity analyses (available upon request) on the initial fraction
of infected agents I0 . We find the relative gains of testing and isolation policies continue to
be substantial. We view this finding as suggesting that even if the pandemic is well under
way and testing and isolation policies have not so far been conducted, it is not too late to
implement such policies.

7. Conclusion
We have argued that testing and isolation policies can deliver substantial welfare gains
in the presence of pandemics. These welfare gains come from a reduced number of cumulative
deaths and a shallower recession. Our model can readily be extended to allow for exogenous
inflows of agents, some of whom may be infected. Such an extension is useful because we
think of our model as one of a particular region or state, rather than of the world. In this
context, inter-regional and international migration then introduces new sources of infections.
In many situations, the new entering agents can be identified, and the testing and isolation
of these agents is clearly valuable. Our findings also suggest that even if a pandemic is well
under way, testing and isolation policies are very valuable.

where R0 is given by (8), Li is given by (14), Y is given by the CES aggregator over yi given
by (15), and I = 1 − S − R.
Clearly, the continuation value is decreasing in I˜0 . We will use this result in the proof.
Let λ = λwork . Suppose, by way of contradiction, that λ < 1 and τ < 1. We will construct
a variation that increases λ and τ while keeping current output constant. We will show that
this variation reduces I˜0 and thereby raises welfare. This contradiction establishes the proof.
To this end, totally differentiate output with respect to τ and λ holding all other variables
fixed. We have that

Note that since ξ = 1, output equals L. Since output is held constant, the rate of infections
is now determined solely by
(1 − τ θs ) λ2 (1 − τ θI ) .
Differentiating this expression, substituting from (21), and simplifying, we get that the sign
