ABSTRACT
Since social distancing is the primary strategy for slowing the spread of many diseases,
understanding why U.S. counties respond differently to COVID-19 is critical for designing
effective public policies. Using daily data from about 45 million mobile phones to measure social
distancing we examine how counties responded to both local COVID-19 cases and statewide
shelter-in-place orders. We find that social distancing increases more in response to cases and
official orders in counties where individuals historically (1) engaged less in community activities
and (2) demonstrated greater willingness to incur individual costs to contribute to social
objectives. Our work highlights the importance of these two features of social capital—
community engagement and individual commitment to societal institutions—in formulating
public health policies.

1. INTRODUCTION
U.S. communities have responded very differently to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data
from about 45 million phones indicates that the proportion of people staying at home during the
typical day in the average U.S. county grew by 42% from February to April 2020 with a crosscounty standard deviation of 23%, highlighting the enormous heterogeneity in the degree to
which people socially distanced in response to the pandemic. Since social distancing is the
primary strategy for slowing the spread of many diseases, understanding the sources of these
differences is critical for designing and implementing effective public policies for this and future
public health emergencies.
At a broad level, social capital theory offers clear predictions about the provision of
public goods and hence about cross-county differences in the extent to which people socially
distanced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Social capital refers to the shared values,
accepted norms, reciprocal bonds, and trust among a group of individuals that allow individuals
within that group to communicate and cooperate to help its members and address collective
challenges (e.g., Loury 1977; Bourdieu 1986; Coleman 1988; Fukuyama 1995; Putnam 2000).
Accordingly, social capital is a resource that helps communities provide public goods, including
by facilitating collaborative actions to bolster public health (e.g., House et al. 1988; Pretty 2003;
Snyder-Mackler et al 2020).
At a more granular level, however, it is critical to distinguish between two distinct features
of social capital indicators in formulating predictions social distancing One category of social
capital indicators focuses on community engagement. Putnam (2000) famously highlighted
bowling teams in making the broad point that people’s engagement in community activities—
including sports teams, clubs, religious, groups, civic organization, etc.—provides information on
the community’s ability to cooperate and provide public goods. For the special case of social
distancing as public good, however, community engagement suggests that people will find it more
costly to separate from these highly-valued social connections. From this perspective, counties
with stronger community engagement will tend to engage in less—not more—social distancing in

response to the pandemic. The second category of social capital indicators focuses on individual
commitment to social institutions, which Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2011) and Barrios et al.
(2020) call civic capital. The intuition is that when people demonstrate that they are willing and
able to incur a cost to contribute to societal objectives, such as voting, completing census forms,
donating blood, etc., this provides information about the community’s ability to marshal its
individuals to address collective problems. From this perspective, when individual commitment to
broader social objectives is stronger in a community, the community is likely to exhibit greater
social distancing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the community engagement and
individual commitment to social institutions features of social capital might exert opposite effects
on social distancing.
In this paper, we examine the degree to which social capital characteristics—as measured
both by community engagement and individual commitment to social institutions—account for
differences in social distancing across U.S. counties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To
measure social distancing in each county, we use daily data from January 22, 2020 through the
end of April 2020 on the percentage of mobile phones that do not leave home. We use two daily
indicators of a county’s “exposure” to the pandemic: the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
in the county during the previous week, and the number of social distancing orders (SDOs)
imposed by the county’s state, e.g., orders to stay home, avoid social gathering, close schools,
close restaurants, close other non-essential businesses. Since local COVID-19 cases and SDOs
might each induce social distancing, we examine how a county’s social capital shapes its social
distancing response to both new local cases and SDOs. To measure social capital, we use prepandemic county-level data collected by the U.S. Congress and Penn State’s Northeast Regional
Center for Rural Development. Although much of the empirical research on social capital uses
only aggregate social capital indexes, we examine both the aggregate indexes and the individual
components to assess the different predictions concerning the community engagement and
individual commitment to social institutions features of social capital.

We discover strong evidence that (1) social capital helps account for cross-county
differences in social distancing, but (2) it is essential to distinguish between community
engagement and individual commitment to social institutions indicators of social capital and not
simply use overall indexes. Specifically, the sensitivity of social distancing to both local
COVID-19 cases and statewide mobility restrictions is (a) weaker in counties with stronger
community engagement and hence with greater costs to social distancing and (a) stronger in
counties with stronger individual commitment and hence where individuals internalize the social
benefits of social distancing. In contrast, the findings on overall composite social capital indexes
are fragile and inconsistent. Only by examining the individual features of social capital indicators
does a clear pattern emerge: When communities are heavily engaged in community activities, it
is specially costly to disengage from these human connections and socially distance; and, when
individuals are more committed to contributing to social goals, they are more willing to incur the
costs and inconveniences of social distancing to contribute to public objectives. Both community
engagement and individual commitment are features of social capital, but they exert opposite
influences on social distancing.

2. DATA AND PATTERNS
2.1 Data sources and definition
We use U.S. county-level data on social distancing, social capital, COVID-19 cases, and
other country traits and state-level data on social distancing orders (SDOs) to examine how the
relationships between social distancing and both COVID-19 cases and SDOs differ by social
capital. In this section, we describe the key data sources and variables and illustrate patterns
across the U.S. counties. Table 1 provides summary statistics.
To measure social distancing, we use the variable Stay Homect, which equals the
percentage of mobile devices in county c on day t that do not leave home, where “home” is
defined as the most common nighttime location of the device in recent months and is identified

to a precision of 100 square meters.1 We obtain this information from the data company,
SafeGraph, that has provided mobility data to researchers since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic. Working with mobile applications that obtain opt-in consent from users to collect
anonymous location data, SafeGraph obtains information from about 45 million mobile
smartphones.
To measure local exposure to COVID-19, we use Casesct , which equals is the natural
logarithm of one plus the number of new COVID-19 cases in county c during the week before
day t, i.e., from t-7 through t-1. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns
Hopkins University provides these data.
To measure SDOs, we use information on statewide mobility restrictions. U.S. states
enacted different SDOs at different times. They instituted five categories of SDOs: stay-at-home
orders, the closing of restaurants and bars, the closing of other non-essential businesses, limits on
social gatherings, and the closing of schools. We use the measure Restrictionsst, which equals the
total number of the five categories of SDOs in place on day t in state s.
To measure social capital, we use eight county-level measures that were computed before
the COVID-19 pandemic by two sources: the U.S. Congress (Joint Economic Committee) and
Penn State’s Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development (e.g., Rupasingha, Goetz, and
Freshwater 2006). The four U.S. Congress social capital measures are as follows.
Social capital (US Congress) is an overall index of social capital that aggregates
information on three subcomponents: (1) family unity, (2) community health, i.e.,
community cohesion and engagement, and (3) institutional health, i.e., trust and
confidence in institutions.

The results reported below are robust to using several alternative measures of social distancing provided by
SafeGraph. We considered three variants of Stay Home. Stay Home (non-FT) is the same as Stay Home except that it
excludes devices owned by a full-time workers and Stay Home (non-working) excludes devices owned by a full-time
worker or part-time worker. Stay Home (Diff) is the percentage change in Stay Home relative to the pre-pandemic
average, which is the average percent of devices staying at home each day during the seven days ending February
12, 2020. Furthermore, we considered visits non-essential businesses, such as restaurants and bars, stores and
shopping malls, theaters, and spas, hair salons, personal care services. The results hold when using these measures.

Community health measures the degree to which individuals engage in community
activities. It includes information the number of non-religious non-profits organizations,
religious congregations, and the degree of community involvement in informal social
activities such as attending public meetings, helping neighbors, and taking part in
political affairs
Institutional health measures commitment to society and trust in institutions. It includes
information on the proportion of the voting age population that voted in 2012 and 2016
presidential elections, the response rate to the 2010 census, and survey-based indicators
of the degree of confidence in institutions.
Family unity measures family structure and stability within a county and includes
information on the share of births in the past year to women who were unmarried, the
share of women between 33 and 45 years old who are currently married and not
separated, and the share of children living in single-parent households.
The four Penn State social capital measures are as follows:
Social capital (Penn State) is an overall index of social capital at the county level that
aggregates information on community activities and commitment to society, such as
participation in the presidential election and the response rate to the Census Bureau’s
decennial census.
Associations (normalized) is an index of the combined number of (a) establishments
related to community activities and (b) non-profit organizations (excluding
internationally-focused NPOs) per 1,000 people.2 Establishments related to community

2
To calculate normalized association index, we (1) compute the min-max scaled version of the number of
establishments per 1,000 people in a county, (2) compute the min-max scaled version of number of non-profit
organization per 1,000 people in a county, and (3) compute the average of these two scaled versions. We use the
normalized values because there are many fewer non-profit organizations. Appendix Table 1 provides the details of
this calculation. The results hold when simply using the total number of community and non-profit establishments.

activities include sports teams, clubs, and bowling teams, as well as religious, civic,
business, professional, labor, and political establishments.
Voter turnout is the percentage of people who voted in the 2012 Presidential election
relative to eligible voters.
Census response is the proportion of households that responded to the 2010 Census.
U.S. states instituted SDOs as COVID-19 spread across the United States.
The analyses employ data on four other county traits. The first three traits are measured
prior to the pandemic: log(income per capita) is the natural logarithm of personal income per
capita; Population density equals the number of people per square mile; and %aged 65+ is the
percentage of the population that is over 65 years. The fourth trait, Days since 1st case, equals the
number of days since the county had its first confirmed case of COVID-19.
2.2 Patterns
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases. When
examining the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each county through April
30, 2020, Figure 1 illustrates a concentration of cases in the northeast and several urban areas
across the country. When focusing on cases per 100,000 people, Figure 2 documents a more even
distribution of the disease.
Figure 3 documents the degree of social distancing, as measured by Stay Home on April
30, 2020. As shown, there is extensive heterogeneity in the degree to which mobile devices
spend that day at home across U.S. counties. Stay Home on April 30, 2020 is greatest in the
North East, smallest in much of the South and Plains, higher along the West Coast and in the
Rocky Mountain states than in other parts of the country. It is also crucial to note that Stay Home
differs materially across counties within states.
Figures 4-9 illustrate the enormous cross-county heterogeneity in social capital as
measured by Community health, Institutional health, Associations, Voter turnout, Census

response, and Family unity respectively. For example, consider two subcomponents from the
U.S. Congress social capital index: Community health, which measures community engagement
(Figure 4), and Institutional health, which measures individual commitment to social institutions
(Figure 5). As shown, there are regional differences in Community health and Institutional health
and even differences across counties within states. We exploit this heterogeneity in examining
cross-county responses to COVID-19.
We next illustrate the evolution of Stay Home from January 22, 2020 through April 30,
2020 while differentiating between counties with high or low social capital. Specifically, for
each of the individual social capital indicators, we divide counties into those in the top and
bottom quartiles of social capital, using the term “high” for the top quartile and “low” for the
bottom by the sample median and categorize the counties as high or low. We then plot the
evolution of Stay Home for high and low counties for each individual social capital indicator
(Community health, Institutional health, Associations, Voter turnout, Census response, and
Family unity) in Figures 16-21 respectively.
As shown, a gap opens in Stay Home between high and low social capital counties as the
pandemic progresses. There are two key patterns. First, counties with greater community
engagement—as measured by Community health and Association—experience smaller increases
in social distancing (Stay Home) during the pandemic. Second, counties with greater individual
commitment to social institutions—as measured by Community health, Institutional health,
Associations, Voter turnout, and Census response—experience larger increases in social
distancing. We now evaluate whether these patterns are statistically significant and robust to
controlling for other country traits.

3. STATISTICAL ANALYSES
3.1 Regression specification
To examine how the sensitivity of social distancing to COVID-19 cases and SDOs
depends on social capital, we use the following regression specifications:
𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑦 𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒!" = 𝛼𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠!" + 𝛽𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠!" ∗ 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙! + 𝛿! + 𝛿#" + 𝜀!" ,

(1)

and
𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑦 𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒!" = 𝛾𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠#" ∗ 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙! + 𝛿! + 𝛿#" + 𝜖!" ,

(2)

where 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 is one of the eight county-level social capital measures defined above, 𝛿!
and 𝛿#" denote county and state-day fixed effects, respectively, and 𝜀!" and 𝜖!" are error terms.
By including 𝛿! , the analyses control for all time-invariant county traits, such as the level and
distribution of income, population density, demographics, geographic location, etc. By including
𝛿#" , the analyses control for all time-varying state characteristics, as well as all time-varying
national and international factors. Since Casesct is measured at the county-day level, it can enter
independently in equation (1). Since Restrictionsst is measured at the state-day level, it is
absorbed by 𝛿#" and does not enter independently in equation (2).
The estimates for 𝛽 and 𝛾 provide information on whether the relationship between Stay
Home and Cases and Restrictions respectively differs by the degree of social capital in the
county. For example, if 𝛾 > 0, this suggest that a state’s SDOs have bigger effects on shelteringin-place in counties in the state with greater social capital. We examine both Cases and
Restrictions because they each represent signals about the pandemic that might induce people to
socially distance. In the regressions, there are about 300,000 county-day observations across
3,000 counties, depending on the specific variables used in the analyses. We report
heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the county level.

3.2 Results
We find conflicting results on the two composite social capital indicators, Social capital
(US Congress) and Social capital (Penn State). As reported in Table 2, when examining Social
capital (US Congress), the results suggest that the sensitivity of Stay Home to both Cases and
Restrictions is greater in counties with more social capital. However, when examining Social
capital (Penn State), the results suggest the opposite: the estimates indicate that social
distancing is less responsive to Cases and Restrictions in counties with more social capital.
As discussed above, one possible explanation for these findings is that (1) the community
engagement and individual commitment features have opposite effects on social distancing and
(2) the two composite social capital indexes put different weights on these underlying features.
In particular, when community engagement is stronger—and people spend more time with others
through teams, clubs, organizations, and association, people in that community might be more
reluctant to separate from those highly-valued connections and socially distance. Since the
Community health and Associations indicators are designed to measure community engagement,
this would suggest the counties with higher Community health and Associations values will
socially distance less in response to Cases or Restrictions than otherwise similar counties. In
turn, when individual commitment to broader social institutions is stronger—and people are
more likely to vote, fill-out census forms, contribute to social institutions, people in that
community might be more willing to incur the inconveniences of social distancing. This suggests
that counties with higher Institutional health, Voter turnout, and Census response will socially
distance more in response to the pandemic. This cost-benefit view of social capital and social
distancing also yields predictions about Family unity. Specifically, given the especially
pronounced challenges to single parents of coordinating work, childcare, and household
obligations while sheltering-in-place and the comparatively high “loneliness” costs to single
adults from sheltering-in-place, counties with higher Family unity will tend to value the net
benefits from social distancing higher than in communities with more single parents or single
adults.

10

The results are consistent with this explanation. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the
sensitivity of Stay Home to both Cases and Restrictions is (1) weaker in counties with higher
Community health and Associations and (2) stronger in counties with higher Institutional health,
Voter turnout, Census response, and Family unity. When people in a county face comparatively
high costs to disengaging from the community, e.g., when Community health and Associations
are larger, social distancing is relatively less sensitive to the pandemic. In turn, the willingness
and ability of people in a county to contribute to broad social goals and institutions—as proxied
by Institutional health, Voter turnout, Census response, and Family unity—is positively
associated with social distancing in response to new local COVID-19 cases and official social
distancing restrictions. The estimated effects are considerable. For example, consider two
otherwise similar counties in the same state, where the “high” county has Institutional heath at
the 75th percentile of the sample distribution and the “low” county has Institutional heath at the
25th percentile, so that the difference in Institutional heath is 1.35. Next “expose” these two
counties to the same policy change, where the state increases Restrictions from 0 to 4. The
estimated coefficient in column (3) of Table 4 suggests that the increase in the percentage of
mobile phones that do not leave home each day would be almost four percentage points greater
in the high Institutional health county relative to the low one. For comparison purposes, about 28
percent of mobile devices stay at home on average day in the average county.
The results are also robust to controlling for other county factors that could shape the
sensitivity of social distancing to Cases and Restrictions. For example, the sensitivity of social
distancing to COVID-19 cases and official mobility restrictions could depend on the level of
income in the county, the county’s population density, the proportion of older people in the
county, and the number of days since the county had its first confirmed COVID-19 case since
these factors might shape the perceived costs and benefits from sheltering-in-place both in terms
of health and economics. We were concerned that omitting the interaction between these country
characteristics and Cases and Restrictions might yield biased estimates of 𝛽 and 𝛾 when
estimating equations (1) and (2). As shown in Tables (5) and (6), however, all of the results hold

11

when including, respectively, the interaction between Cases and Restrictions and log(income per
capita), Population density , and %aged 65+, and Days since 1st case. Including these additional
interaction terms attenuates the estimated coefficients on 𝛽 and 𝛾, but all of the parameters
remain statistically significant and of the same sign.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Social capital helps account for the enormous cross-county differences in social
distancing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; but, it is essential to distinguish between the
community engagement and individual commitment to societal institutions features of social
capital to understand how county characteristics shape social distancing choices. The sensitivity
of social distancing to COVID-19 cases and SDOs is weaker in counties with stronger
community engagement and stronger in counties with stronger individual commitment to societal
institutions. That is, when individuals in a community participate more intensively in community
activities, they find it especially difficult to disengage from those activities and socially distance.
In turn, when individuals in a community demonstrate their commitment to contributing to social
goals, they find it easier to socially distance to contribute to public health. These two features of
social capital work in opposite directions in shaping the degree to which communities socially
distanced in response to the pandemic.

Table 2 Social Distancing in Response to the Pandemic: Aggregate social capital indexes
This table presents regression results of the relationship between social distancing and both new COVID-19 cases and
official restrictions on mobility as functions of social capital. The dependent variable is Stay Home, which is the
percentage of mobile devices in a county that do not leave home during the day. Cases is the natural logarithm of one
plus the average number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the previous seven days in the county.
Restrictions is the total number of restrictions on mobility in each country in each day, where these restrictions include
stay-at-home orders, the closing of restaurants and bars, the closing of other non-essential businesses, limits on social
gatherings, and the closing of schools. Social capital (US congress) is an overall index of social capital that aggregates
information on (1) family unity, (2) community health, i.e., engagement in community activities, and (3) institutional
health, i.e., commitment to society and trust in social institutions. Social capital (PennState) is an overall index of
social capital that aggregates information on Associations, i.e., participation in community activities and non-profit
organizations, and the degree to which people in a county turnout to vote (Voter turnout) and complete the census
(Census report). The regressions include county and state-day fixed effects. The table reports t-statistics in parentheses,
based on robust standard errors clustered at the county level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10%
respectively.

Table 3 Social Distancing in Response to New Cases: Individual Social Capital Indicators
This table presents regression results of the relationship between social distancing and new COVID-19 cases as functions of the individual social capital indicators.
The dependent variable is Stay Home, which is the percentage of mobile devices in a county that do not leave home during the day. Cases is the natural logarithm
of one plus the average number of daily new COVID-19 cases during the previous seven days in the county. The social capital indicators include (1) Community
health, which measures the degree to which individuals engage in community activities, (2) Associations (normalized), which is an index of the combined number
of establishments related to community activities and non-profit organizations per 1,000 people, (3) Institutional health, which measures commit to society and
trust in institutions, (4) Voter turnout, which is the percentage of people who voted in the 2012 Presidential election relative to eligible voters, (5) Census response,
which is the proportion of households that responded to the 2010 Census, and (6) Family unity, which measures family structure and stability within a county. The
regressions include county and state-day fixed effects. The table reports t-statistics in parentheses based on robust standard errors clustered at the county level. ***,
