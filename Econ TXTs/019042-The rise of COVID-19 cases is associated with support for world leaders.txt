COVID-19 has emerged as one of the deadliest and most disruptive
events in recent human history. Drawing from political science and
psychological theories, we examine the effects of daily confirmed
cases in a country on citizens’ support for the political leader through
the first 120 d of 2020. Using three unique datasets which comprise
daily approval ratings of head of government (n = 1,411,200) across
11 world leaders (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) and weekly approval ratings of governors across the 50 states
in the United States (n = 912,048), we find a strong and significant
positive association between new daily confirmed and total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country and support for the heads of
government. These analyses show that political leaders received a
boost in approval in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Moreover, these findings suggest that the previously documented
“rally ‘round the flag” effect applies beyond just intergroup conflict.

s of May 1, 2020, COVID-19 had already infected over
3 million and killed 250,000 people. Many political leaders
and governments were criticized for their responses to the pandemic. The US government was criticized for insufficiently testing
its citizens during the early stages of the crisis (1); the Japanese
government was criticized for not declaring a national emergency
sooner than they did, in the hope of hosting the Olympic Games as
planned (2); medical doctors and nurses in Hong Kong went on
strike due to government’s inefficiency in handling the pandemic
(3). All of these anecdotes suggest that world leaders should suffer
in their political ratings during this crisis, because many, if not all,
countries have failed to aggressively address this pandemic effectively. Indeed, even the best possible outcome from COVID-19
would involve distressingly high numbers of infected and dead and
a severe impact on the economy, leaving political leaders vulnerable to bad publicity.
The political science literature, however, suggests another
possibility. Specifically, the “rally ‘round the flag” effect suggests
that citizens tend to support their national leaders in times of
international crises (4–6). The rally effect can be explained by
enhanced feelings of patriotism, under the perception that one’s
group is under attack and hence unity is required to defend the
group and support the incumbent (4). Identified in the 1970s, the
rally effect has received empirical support in many international
crises. US presidents’ approval ratings increased during the
Cuban missile crisis, Iran hostage crisis, Gulf War, 9/11 terrorist
attack, and the death of Osama bin Laden (7–9).
Here we explore whether this rally effect generalizes beyond
intergroup conflict to leaders’ approval ratings during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Most, if not all, events that triggered the
rally effect examined by prior research were limited to contexts of
interpersonal and intercountry violence, involved primarily the US
president, and were anthropogenic hazards. In this paper, we integrate the political science literature with psychological theories
to suggest that COVID-19, an international public health crisis,
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2009252117

would also lead to increased political support for one’s national
leader. Most importantly, we hypothesize that this effect may transcend individuals’ political ideologies, and generalize beyond the
United States to world leaders from diverse cultural backgrounds.
Multiple psychological theories converge to support this hypothesis. System justification theory posits that people are motivated to justify and rationalize the way things are, even when
the social, political, or economic systems negatively affect their
self-interest (10, 11). Perceived threat and powerlessness are key
triggers of system justification beliefs, leading people to support
the status quo and display increased trust toward authorities such
as governments, because doing so reduces uncertainty and
minimizes the perceived threat (11, 12). Past research finds that
liberals and conservatives show the same system justification
behaviors and beliefs being exposed to threats (13).
Research on cultural evolution provides a complementary
explanation for this effect. Cultural evolutionary models suggest
that adherence to group norms and support for group leaders
can preserve group unity and prosociality during times of threat and
scarcity (14). In particular, tightness−looseness theory suggests that
group cohesion and coordination are necessary for human groups
to overcome existential threats, and so it is functional for human
groups to rally around strong leaders in the face of these threats
(15) (see SI Appendix for a more in-depth discussion).
The rally effect identified in these literatures provide some
conceptual support for a counterintuitive hypothesis—citizens
should increasingly endorse their national leaders as the COVID19 pandemic worsens. We therefore predict that COVID-19 cases
Significance
Amid the present COVID-19 pandemic, we find that many citizens around the world “rally ‘round the flag” and increase their
support for their respective political leaders. We observe these
findings among countries that are culturally and geographically diverse, and even among leaders who are strongly disliked by citizens prior to the pandemic. Our findings could have
important voting implications during or immediately after the
pandemic. As an example, the Korean ruling party won the
most seats in the house by any party since 1960 in an election
held during the pandemic in April 2020. COVID-19 might thus
serve as a catalyst to help some incumbent governments.

should be linked with higher levels of support for national leaders,
regardless of their performance in handling the pandemic.
Because the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, monthly
political polling would not be able to capture these swift changes.
Thus, we use three unique datasets that survey citizens’ political
approval ratings of their leaders with high temporal resolution
and power. The first dataset includes daily approval ratings of
the chief executive of Hong Kong, the Special Administrative
Region of China (n = 98,875 daily ratings from February 3 to
April 30, 2020). The second dataset includes daily approval
ratings of the prime ministers and presidents across 10 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States (n =
1,312,325 daily ratings from January 1 to April 30, 2020), and
the third dataset includes weekly approval ratings of the 50 US
governors (n = 912,048) from the week of January 1 through
the week of May 11, 2020.
Our datasets offer us unique strengths. In the Hong Kong
dataset, we are able to test our hypothesis in a conservative
manner, because the chief executive’s political ratings had been
relatively low due to the city’s recent political unrest and the city
has confirmed a very small number of COVID-19 cases. This
restriction of range provides a very conservative test for our
hypotheses. However, participants in these data were recruited
via online convenience sampling and may not be representative
of the general population. This weakness is mitigated in the broader
cross-country and cross-state datasets, which included representative samples. These datasets also gave us the opportunity to test
our hypothesis across countries and states that differ dramatically
in their culture, geography, and responsiveness to COVID-19.

Analytic Strategy. We tested our hypotheses with a series of mul-

tilevel multiple regressions, where leader approval was regressed
on new and total documented COVID-19 cases. Documented
cases do not reflect the actual number of COVID-19 cases, but
they are appropriate for our analysis, since the public has access to
documented cases rather than true cases. The bivariate distribution of cases and leader approval appeared to be better characterized by a logarithmic relationship than a linear relationship
(Fig. 1), and models containing log-transformed approval showed
substantially higher fit than models with no log transformation or
log-transformed COVID-19 cases (SI Appendix). For this reason, we
log-transformed leader approval before testing our hypotheses. Our
results are substantively the same whether or not we employed log
transformation (SI Appendix).
For the Hong Kong analysis, we fit a multilevel model to account for the fact that days were nested in individuals. We also
replicated our results controlling for age, gender, and political
orientation (scored from 1 to 4, where higher values were more
liberal). For the cross-country and cross-state analysis, we fit
multilevel models to account for the fact that days were nested in
nations. We also within-group centered the number of cases to
avoid confounding cross-group (level-2) variation in COVID-19
cases and leader approval with within-group (level-1) variation in
these variables across time. This centering strategy made our
analyses exclusively focused on level-1 variation. Thus, we did not
include level-2 covariates such as GDP per capita, since these variables would not affect level-1 variation. We estimated effect size by
1) estimating the number of cases that would translate to an additional boost in approval rating and 2) estimating standardized βs
(COVID-19 cases were standardized within groups to avoid pooling
level-1 and level-2 variance). While there is no universal measure of
effect size for multilevel models, these techniques help communicate the real-world implications of our effects.
In supplemental models within SI Appendix, we explore potential
group-level moderators of the rally effect. Our cross-country dataset
did not include enough group-level power to test for moderation,
2 of 5 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2009252117

but our cross-state data were suitable for moderation analyses, since
they included favorability ratings from each of the 50 US states. SI
Appendix summarizes literature on the potential moderators of
the rally effect in more depth, and evidence for each of these
accounts. SI Appendix also contains a robustness analysis showing
that our results replicate while excluding days without a single
COVID-19 case.
Models. Our Hong Kong regression revealed a robust effect of
COVID-19 new, b = 0.0004, β = 0.01, SE = 0.00004, t(78090) =
8.61, P < 0.001, and total, b = 0.00001, β = 0.01, SE = 0.000002,
t(78510) = 7.58, P < 0.001, cases on leader approval. The effects
of new, b = 0.0004, β = 0.01, SE = 0.00004, t(70300) = 10.08, P <
0.001, and total, b = 0.00002, β = 0.01, SE = 0.000002, t(70770) =
9.88, P < 0.001, cases replicated controlling for age, gender, and
self-reported political orientation. While these effects were
small, each model suggested that days with more COVID-19
cases had higher approval for the chief executive of Hong Kong.
Our cross-country models revealed a similar dynamic. Daily
new, b = 0.00001, β = 0.09, SE = 0.000002, t(1200) = 6.31, P <
0.001, and total, b = 0.000001, β = 0.09, SE = 0.0000001,
t(1200) = 6.46, P < 0.001, cases were robustly associated with
leader approval. Specifically, 1,995.21 daily new COVID-19
cases translated to an additional point of leader approval. To put
this number into context, the United States averaged about
30,000 new cases per day in April, whereas the United Kingdom
averaged about 4,000 new cases per day in April. Fig. 1 displays
this relationship in general, and by country. Table 1 summarizes
each country in this analysis by its change in approval from
January 1 to April 30, its number of COVID-19 cases as of April
30, and the standardized relationship between COVID-19 cases
and favorability, estimated via ordinary least-squares regression
models. In SI Appendix, we explore lagged models which suggest
that COVID-19 cases and leader approval are characterized by
an instantaneous relationship—moving together in time—and
discuss the meaning of this relationship.
Our regression model revealed a similarly robust effect of
COVID-19 cases on gubernatorial approval. Daily new, b =
0.00002, β = 0.22, SE = 0.000001, t(947) = 11.52, P < 0.001, and
total, b = 0.000003, β = 0.19, SE = 0.0000003, t(947) = 9.73, P <
0.001, cases were both robustly associated with governor approval. Our models suggest that 5,305.04 new COVID-19 cases
would translate to an additional point of governor approval. To
put this into context, California had over 40,000 new documented cases in April, whereas North Carolina, which was less
severely affected in April, had ∼9,000 new documented cases.
Fig. 2 displays a time series of weekly COVID-19 cases (in red)
against weekly approval (in blue). On average, US governors’
approval increased 19.08% from January 1 until May 11.
In sum, rises in COVID-19 cases were associated with higher
approval across nations and American states. Yet this effect size
varied. For example, the effect of new COVID-19 cases was far
stronger in Canada (β = 0.90) than in Mexico (β = −0.07), and it
was stronger in Illinois (β = 0.63) than in Alaska (β = 0.13). It is
plausible that this variation is related to cultural factors such
as tightness−looseness, political factors such as conservatism, or the
efficacy with which leaders have acted in the face of the pandemic.
However, exploratory analyses of our cross-state data did not
show support for these moderators. The only significant moderator in this analysis indicated that states with a history of disasters showed a slightly smaller boost than states with fewer
natural disasters in their recent history (b = −0.33, P = 0.04; SI
Appendix). These analyses should be interpreted with caution,
since we did not have the power to replicate them at the national
level. Nevertheless, they do suggest that some of the theorized
moderators of the rally effect may not apply during the COVID-19
pandemic, and may only apply to certain threats such as warfare.
Yam et al.

Discussion
Our analysis of daily political approval ratings across 11 countries/regions and 50 US states supports our hypothesis that new
daily COVID-19 cases are positively associated with political
favorability on the same day. A limitation is that our data were
correlational, which means that we cannot make causal claims.

However, our models show that the association between
COVID-19 cases and approval ratings holds in a sample of 11
geographically and culturally diverse countries and across the
50 US states, and even among world leaders who are widely
unpopular prior to the pandemic. That said, we do note that the
rally effect is stronger for some countries than others (Table 1).

Shown are country-specific change in approval ratings, COVID-19 cases, and country-specific general linear models estimating the relationship between the
two. Change in approval is calculated by the difference between approval on the first available day and the final available day, COVID-19 cases are documented
cases as of April 30 data, and difference in approval ratings is calculated by the difference between the first available day and the last available day. Hong Kong
data come from a different dataset than the other cultures, and Hong Kong estimates come from a multilevel model rather than a general linear model.

Materials and Methods
We purchased the Hong Kong data from Hong Kong Public Opinion Research
Institute (HKPOP; https://www.pori.hk/), and purchased the cross-country
data from Morning Consult (https://morningconsult.com/). We confirmed
that we reported all available dates and countries in which daily political
approval ratings data were collected. Morning Consult also collected data
from Russian and Chinese participants. However, political approval rating
was not part of the survey in these two countries, and hence we are unable
to include these two countries in the analyses.

Cross-Country and Cross-State Data. Morning Consult recruited its participants
using a stratified sampling approach, by matching their participant pools with
a given nation’s or state’s official government census data, based on age,
gender, region, and education (plus ethnicity in the United States and 50 US
states). For the cross-country data, ∼300 to 500 unique individuals from each
country were polled daily, except in the United States, where ∼6,000 unique
individuals were polled daily. For the cross-state data, ∼61 (Alaska) to 3,500
(Florida) unique individuals from each state were polled weekly. Attention
check items were employed to screen out inattentive respondents. All survey
questions were provided in languages appropriate for the participants’
countries, translated and localized by professional translation firms. We note
that the state approval rating data also contained approval of two governors who left office in early 2020 (Matt Bevin of Kentucky and Phil Bryant of
Mississippi) and were replaced. We removed ratings of these ex-governors to
avoid confounding change over time in approval with change in governor.

Data on COVID-19 Cases and Tests. We obtained data on national daily rates of
total and new confirmed COVID-19 cases from Johns Hopkins (https://coronavirus.
jhu.edu/). We obtained statewide data on COVID-19 cases and testing from the
COVID tracking project (https://covidtracking.com/), which provided daily estimates of cases and tests for each state, which we aggregated to the week
level to match the governor approval data. Prior to analysis, we identified 13
data points in the COVID tracking data with negative testing values. According
to the COVID tracking project, these artificial negative values arose from an

Hong Kong Data. HKPOP recruited panelists in random telephone surveys, and
interested participants provided their contact information and demographic
information. In this particular survey, HKPOP recruited participants through
daily email surveys and asked participants to provide ratings of the chief
executive and other social issues. All survey questions were provided in both
English and Cantonese. Because of convenience sampling, this sample skewed
female, and were younger and more politically liberal than the general
population in Hong Kong. HKPOP provided individual raw data for our research, which allowed us to use hierarchical linear modeling to test our
hypotheses. The total number of unique individuals in this sample is 21,904.

The cross-country dataset indexed approval through a single number
from −50 to 50, and we transformed this to a 0 to 100 scale by adding 50.
The cross-state dataset indexed approval through two separate “approval”
and “disapproval” indicators, each from 0 to 100. We created a single approval
variable by subtracting disapproval from approval, and then adding 50. This
transformation eliminated any negative values, enabling log transformation,
but it also meant that favorability values exceeded 100 for the most popular
governors (e.g., Larry Hogan of Maryland).
Because these data are proprietary, we do not have access to individual
raw data. Instead, Morning Consult provided us the daily aggregated data for
each country and state, which were used for data analyses.

Approval

Another limitation of our analysis is that we cannot estimate the
time course of this effect. Since we collected our data, Donald
Trump’s approval rating has dropped, whereas Justin Trudeau’s
approval rating appears to have remained high. This may be because the rally effect decays over time, or becomes more sensitive
to how leaders have handled a threat, but these possibilities go
beyond the scope of our data.
Our findings could have important voting implications. If citizens
do “rally ‘round the flag,” then upcoming elections during or in the
aftermath of COVID-19 could potentially be advantageous for some
incumbents. This suggests that COVID-19 may have an enduring
geopolitical impact long after its acute impacts have subsided.
