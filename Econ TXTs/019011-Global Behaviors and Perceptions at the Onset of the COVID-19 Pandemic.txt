ABSTRACT
We conducted a large-scale survey covering 58 countries and over 100,000 respondents between
late March and early April 2020 to study beliefs and attitudes towards citizens’ and governments’
responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents reacted strongly to the crisis: they
report engaging in social distancing and hygiene behaviors, and believe that strong policy
measures, such as shop closures and curfews, are necessary. They also believe that their
government and their country’s citizens are not doing enough and underestimate the degree to
which others in their country support strong behavioral and policy responses to the pandemic.
The perception of a weak government and public response is associated with higher levels of
worries and depression. Using both cross-country panel data and an event-study, we additionally
show that strong government reactions correct misperceptions, and reduce worries and
depression. Our findings highlight that policy-makers not only need to consider how their
decisions affect the spread of COVID-19, but also how such choices influence the mental health
of their population.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has substantially
changed public and private life in most countries around the world. To contain the spread of the
disease, governments first called on individuals to change their hygiene and social behaviors
(e.g., avoiding handshakes, washing hands more frequently, and avoiding social gatherings),
and subsequently imposed more stringent and costly protection measures, such as school and
store closures, and stay-at-home orders (1, 2). While some of the less invasive measures have
received sustained public support during past epidemics (3), adherence to and support of measures that are perceived as costliest, such as quarantines, has been mixed (4). Several questions
thus emerge with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic: Do people adhere to recommendations
by the government? How do people perceive the response of their fellow citizens and their
governments? And in light of rising concerns as a result of the COVID-19 crisis (5–7), how is
people’s mental health affected by government measures to contain the pandemic?
To shed light on these questions, we conducted a global online survey. Volunteers recruited
through social media translated a short questionnaire into 69 languages. Survey participants
were recruited globally through online snowball sampling (the survey instrument is provided in
SI-B). Between March 20 and April 5, 2020, more than 110,000 individuals from 175 countries
participated. At the launch of the survey, on March 20th, there had been 240,000 confirmed
COVID-19 cases and 9,900 people deaths attributed to COVID-19 (8). Among the 32 countries
with more than 1,000 confirmed cases, 47 percent had required workplace closures and 39
percent had imposed some form of restriction to internal mobility. Two weeks later, on April
5th, confirmed cases and deaths had increased four and five-fold, respectively. By then, over
85 percent of the countries with more than 1,000 confirmed cases had adopted various forms
of workplace closure and restrictions to internal movement (9). Our data thus capture global

2

public attitudes in the early and accelerating phases of the pandemic, both before and after
many governments faced challenging yet consequential policy decisions. In this article, we
report results from the 58 countries in which at least 200 people participated, corresponding to
a sample of 107,565 individuals. As of April 5th 2020, these countries accounted for 92% of
all known COVID-19 cases globally, and 93% of deaths. In the analyses presented below, we
re-weight observations to make them representative at the country level, based on respondent’s
gender, age, income, and education. Depending on the focus of the analysis, we also weight
according to country population, or give all countries equal weight.

Broad adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors and support for containment measures

We document broad adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviors in Figure 1, Panel A.

Globally, 91% of respondents reported that they did not attend any social gatherings in the past
week; 89% washed their hands more frequently than a month earlier; 93% say that they would
have immediately informed people around them if they had experienced COVID-19 symptoms;
69% reported keeping a distance of at least 2 meters to other people; and 78% said that they
stayed home in the past week (SI Figure 4 presents the country-level averages). People also
plan to maintain these behaviors in the future; for example, while 42% of respondents report
that they will leave their home in the next 5 days to buy food, only 19% say that they will go to
work, and 45% of respondents say that they will not leave their home for any reason in the next
5 days. Thus, respondents report closely adhering to protective behaviors.1
In line with their own behavior, a large majority of respondents believe that it is important
for others to engage in protective behaviors (Figure 1, Panel B, dark gray bars): 97% believe
that people in their country should cancel their participation in social gatherings because of
1

Broad adherence to COVID-19 protective measures has been noted for Italy (10). Our study complements
work studying heterogeneity in responses to the COVID-19 outbreak using survey and cell phone data, with a
particular focus on partisan ideology (11–13).

COVID-19; 92% say people should not shake each other’s hands; 77% think that all shops
other than particularly important ones, such as supermarkets, pharmacies, post offices, and gas
stations, should be closed; and 81% support a general curfew that only excepts grocery shopping, necessary family trips, and the commute to work. Moreover, 90% of respondents believe
that social distancing measures are “effective” or “very effective” and 70% of respondents think
that risky behaviors should be financially punished.
In contrast, however, respondents do not believe that their fellow citizens hold similar beliefs
(Figure 1, Panel B, light gray bars). Specifically, while 97% of respondents themselves believe
that social gatherings should be cancelled, on average, they estimate that only 67% of their
fellow citizens think the same—a 30 percentage point gap. Similarly, on average, respondents
believe that 74% of people in their country support avoiding handshakes (18 percentage point
gap); that 63% of people believe stores should be closed (14 percentage point gap); and that
55% are in favor of curfews (26 percentage point gap). Thus, respondents themselves hold
strong normative beliefs about the importance of avoidance behaviors, but vastly underestimate
the extent to which these beliefs are shared by their fellow citizens. This is important because
both respondents’ own beliefs and their perceived beliefs of others predict their tendency to
engage in protective behaviors (for both: p < 0.001, see SI-Table 7).2
Globally, fewer than 9% of respondents believe that the response of their country’s government has been too extreme (see Panel C in Figure 1). This pattern holds robustly across
different social groups: when splitting the sample based on country, gender, median income,
and median age, there is not a single socio-economic strata in which a majority of individuals
think that the government reaction has been “somewhat extreme” or “too extreme” (see SI-G.1
for more details). Rather, many respondents believe that their government is not reacting suffi2

This finding is consistent with evidence on pluralistic ignorance (14). Misperceived social norms have been
shown to be an important causal driver of high-stakes behaviors across domains, such as female labor force participation (15) and energy conservation (16).

ciently, with 45% of respondents across the 58 countries holding such beliefs. Similarly, 58%
of respondents perceive that the reaction of their country’s public to the COVID-19 outbreak
has been insufficient. Further, 43% of respondents do not trust that their country’s government
is keeping them safe, and 43% of respondents perceive that their country’s government has not
been truthful about the COVID-19 outbreak. Panel D of Figure 1 however suggests that there
is significant cross-country variation in these measures (see SI-Figure 5 for the cross country
averages). We next explore this cross-country variation further.

Perception of insufficient response by government and broader public is related to lower
mental health, which improves after decisive government action

The widespread per-

ceptions of an insufficient response by both governments and the public across countries are
strongly associated with measures of mental health. In Figure 2, Panel A, we show that higher
perceptions of insufficient government reaction to the pandemic are associated with higher worries about the pandemic (p < 0.001). In Panel B, we extend this analysis to a standard depression scale (PHQ-9, without the suicide question), and a misperception index, which measures
the difference between own attitudes and perceived attitudes of others along the dimensions
discussed above (description of indices and their construction in more detail in SI-C). We also
consider additional explanatory variables, such as COVID-19 case prevalence across countries.
We find that worries about COVID-19 strongly increase with perceptions of an insufficient reaction by the broader public (p = 0.008), and that our depression index strongly correlates with
perceptions of an insufficient government (p = 0.103) and public reaction (p < 0.001). Similarly, our misperception index strongly increases as public and government reactions are viewed
as insufficient (both p < 0.001). In turn, higher trust in governments to keep people safe, and
perceptions of the truthfulness of government communication about the COVID-19 outbreak,
are associated with lower levels of worries and reduced misperceptions (both p < 0.001).

5

Can shifts in government policy affect these perceptions? In Panel C of Figure 2, we document that the adoption of more stringent COVID-19 containment policies increases the perceived sufficiency of the government’s and the public’s response. We use daily country-level
data on the extent of different government COVID-19 interventions (9). To justify a causal
interpretation, we exploit time variation in country-level COVID-19 responses, thus comparing
each country to itself over time. We find that as a country imposes more stringent restrictions
on public life, these changes (i) lower respondents’ perception of an insufficient reaction by the
public (p < 0.001) and the government (p < 0.001); (ii) increase trust that governments keep
people safe (p < 0.01); and (iii) lower the depression index (p < 0.001).
Finally, we provide a more granular view of one such policy change in Panels D, E, and
F of Figure 2. In the evening of March 23, 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced
a nationwide lockdown in the United Kingdom (UK). This represented a drastic change in
the UK’s approach to COVID-19, both relative to itself and relative to other countries. We
estimate a difference-in-differences model, comparing changes in perceptions in the UK before
versus after the change, to changes in other countries at the same time (Germany, Sweden,
the United States, and Brazil; these five countries make up 50% of the whole sample, and we
have sufficient numbers of respondents on each day to estimate a meaningful difference-indifferences specification).
We find that the nationwide lockdown announcement in the UK led to notable effects among
survey participants from the UK compared to participants from other countries. Panel D of Figure 2 shows that the lockdown increased the perceived appropriateness of the government’s
reaction by 18.2 percentage points (p < 0.001), and that of the public’s reaction by 15.3 percentage points (p < 0.001). It also increased trust in the government (10.3 percentage points),
and the government’s perceived truthfulness (5.6 percentage points, p < 0.001). The lockdown
also strongly reduced misperceptions about fellow citizens’ attitudes towards strong behavioral
6

responses to the pandemic (0.52 of a standard deviation, p < 0.001). This suggests that people
don’t think others comply voluntarily, but do when required, and thus that government action
is effective. Finally, the lockdown reduced the worries index by 0.150 of a standard deviation
(p < 0.001), and the depression index by 0.049 of a standard deviation (p < 0.1). Panels
E and F of Figure 2 display the event study for perceived appropriateness of the government
response and the worries index, respectively. There were no noticeable pre-trends before the
announcement of the lockdown on March 23, but we observe a marked change in perceived appropriateness and the worries index on the day following the announcement in the UK relative
to other countries. Thus, timely and decisive government action can reduce misperceptions,
worries, and depression.

Robustness Checks

We conduct several checks to assess the robustness of our findings. First,

the statistics described above used sampling weights to make the samples representative of each
country’s population in terms of age, gender, income, and education (see SI-F B for further
information). When the results are re-estimated without these weights, the changes are minimal
(See SI-Fig 9 and SI-Fig 10).
To examine robustness of our findings to a more representative sample, we repeated the survey with 2,000 participants from a representative online panel provided by Prolific in the United
States and the UK.3 The results from the representative online panel are similar to those obtained
in the main sample, suggesting that the snowball sampling approach we used did not bias our
results (see SI- G.1). We also assessed the relevance of a potential social desirability bias by
incorporating a list experiment in these representative surveys: a random half of participants
(the control group) were presented with a list of four protective measures (e.g., handwashing),
and asked how many of them they favored. The other half of participants (the treatment group)

were presented with the same list of four measures, plus one additional item: whether they
think there should be a curfew in their country (details on list experiment is provided in SI-B.6).
Respondents in the control group on average agreed with 2.91 statements, while respondents in
the treatment group agreed with 3.64 items. The average difference in statements agreed with
between the treatment and control group is thus 0.73, which very closely mirrors the share of
respondents who, when asked directly, agree that there should be a curfew in their country (0.74
in the representative online panel; 0.71 in the main cross-country survey). These results suggest
that social desirability bias did not play an important role when respondents indicated broad
support to protective behaviors, consistent with recent evidence (18).

Conclusion

Our results highlight that people across the world are responding strongly to the

COVID-19 pandemic, both in terms of their own behavior, as well as their beliefs about how
their fellow citizens should react to the crisis. Our analyses also reveal that a majority of respondents believes that their governments and fellow citizens are not doing enough, which
heightens their worries and depression levels. However, decisive actions from policy-makers,
we find, have the ability to alter how people perceive their governments and other citizens, and
in turn improve mental health. As governments around the world debate whether to extend or
loosen restrictions, our findings reveal that policy-makers not only need to consider how their
decisions affect the spread of COVID-19, but also how such choices influence the mental health
of their population.

Notes: This figure shows descriptive statistics of personal and perceptions of societal reactions to COVID-19. Panel A presents self-reported
engagement in protective behavior. Panel B contrasts respondents’ attitudes and perceived attitudes of compatriots about protective behaviors
and policies. Panel C shows the share of respondents who think that the government action has been excessive by country. Panel D displays
cross-country variation in perceptions of sufficiency of government and public reactions to COVID-19 and of trust in and perceived
truthfulness of governments. The sample was collected using snowball sampling from March 20th to April 6th 2020 (N = 107, 565).
Respondents from countries with at least 200 responses are included. Responses are weighted to be representative at the country level in terms
of age, gender, income, and education. Panel A and B are further weighted by country population to account for different country sizes. Panel
C and D display weighted country averages.

Notes: All indices are defined and described in SI-C regressions are further described in SI-E. Respondents from countries with at least 200 responses are included. Panel A shows the
cross-country relationship between the share of respondents perceiving their government’s response as insufficient and a worries index. Panel B captures pairwise relationship between the
variables indicated in the figure heading and row across countries. The regressions in Panel C are estimated using the country x date weighted average data, controlling for country and
day fixed effects; the independent variable is an index of strictness of government response in a country. The regressions in Panel D are estimated using the individual-level data from the
UK and a set of control group countries. The regressions control for country-by-education-by-gender fixed effects and date fixed effects. The independent variable is an indicator variable
taking the value 1 for respondents participating from the UK after the 23 March 2020. Panels E and F illustrate the impact of the UK lockdown announcement among respondents from
the UK compared to the average time trend among participants from control group countries on perceptions of sufficiency of the government response and the worries index. The
underlying data is the survey data that was collected using snowball sampling from March 20th to April 6th 2020 (N= 107,565).

Construction of Indices
Worries index

To measure worries we use all questions from the worries battery in section B.2.6. We construct
the worries index based on the all worries items. We use the z-scored transformation of the sum
of all items. Higher values indicate higher levels of worries.

C.2

Depression Index

To measure depression we employ the widely used personal health questionnaire (1). We construct the PHQ-9 index based on the all items of the PHQ-9 except for the suicide question (for
details on the questions see Section B). We use the z-scored transformation of the sum of all
PHQ-9 items. Higher values indicate higher levels of depression.
23

C.3

Misperception Index

We construct our misperception measures by taking the difference between people’s beliefs
about others’ views minus the actual views of others regarding (i) cancellation of social gatherings, (ii) appropriateness of hand-shakes, (iii) store closures, (iv) a general curfew. We use the
z-scored transformation of the sum of all misperception items to construct our misperception
index. Higher values indicate higher levels of misperceptions.

C.4

Country-level policy restriction index

We leverage the data from (2) that is up to date as of April 6th. The data is a country-by-daily
data set capturing the different measures countries adopt to constrain the spread of COVID-19.
We focus on the main subcomponents S1-S6 capturing government actions grouped as S1 School closures, S2 Workplace closures, S3 Cancelation of public events, S4 Closure of public
transporation, S5 Public information, S6 Restrictions on internal movement, S7 Restrictions on
International travel.
The data distinguishes general - country-wide - restrictions versus targeted ones. Further,
the data distinguishes recommendations versus requirements. We construct restrictions indices
that are specific to our sample-countries and time window and not use the Stringency index
that is provided by (2). This is because for the sample period under consideration, from March
20 to April 5, 2020, most countries had adopted already quite stringent measures with regard
to international travel and public information campaigns. As a result, these and a few other
subcomponents add little variation.
We use the (2) data to create a set of indicator variables that capture whether a country
applied measures in a specific domain S1-S6 that are general – i.e. apply to the country as a
whole. Similarly, we also use a robustness measure that constructs an index based on transformed indicator variables capturing whether restrictions in the domain S1-S6 are general and
24

are mandatory. Using these sets of dummy variables, we then construct the first principal component of the data for the set of countries in our estimations and for the time period under
considerations.
Table 1 presents the factor loadings for the first three principal components for the measures
S1-S6 that are coded as applying countrywide (but are not necessarily mandatory). We observe
that the first principal component is positively loaded with little weight being placed, however,
on the Public Information component. This is not surprising as most countries by March 20,
2020 had ongoing public information efforts.

Table 2 presents the factor loadings for the first three principal components constructed on
the dummy variables capturing general and mandated policy changes. Naturally, informatin
campaigns do not have a “mandatory” dimension. As such, this feature, that already added little
to the variation is dropped. As before we observe positive loading on all subcomponents.

Online survey reach statistics

The link to the survey went live on March 20, 2020 with a call to participate being launched
via social media. That launch produced nearly 1.4 million impressions and was retweeted
4,892 times. The initial tweets account for 31,211 clicks on the landing page http://www.
covid19-survey.org. This is a minority of all clicks on the landing page, indicating that
there was a substantial multiplication due to the link to the survey being broadly shared on social media, via email and through other channels. Several media outlets featured links to the
landing page and the call to participate. The landing page was accessed by 391,476 different
users from March 20 - April 8, 2020. Out of those visitors, 157,264 started the survey, while
112,136 survey completes were registered.

Statistical methodology

This appendix describes the main empirical specifications for which we present regression coefficients in the main figures.

E.1

Figure 1

This figure shows descriptive statistics on reported engagement in protective behavior (panel
A), own and perceived attitudes about what should be done (panel B), as well as perceptions
of government response to the COVID-19 crisis (panels C and D). The sample includes respondents from countries for which we had at least 200 responses (N = 107, 565). For all
four panels, we first collapsed the individual-level data to obtain country-level averages. In this
step, all individual responses were re-weighted to be representative of each respondent’s country’s demographic in terms of age bins, gender, income brackets, and education level using the
weights described in Appendix F. For panels A and B, we then further collapsed the data to

26

generate global sample means. In this step, we weighted the averages by the country’s population for panels A and B. In Panel C and D we present the distribution of the country-averages
to highlight the cross-country variation in the measures.

E.2

Figure 2

This figure shows bivariate and multivariate regressions of perceptions and mental health outcomes on government responses to the Covid-19 crisis. For six panels, we obtained countrylevel averages, weighting individual responses to be representative of each respondent’s country
in terms of age and income brackets, gender, and education level (using the weights described
in detail in Appendix F.
Panel A shows an unweighted country-level scatterplot of the proportion of respondents
who think that government reaction has been insufficient and the worries index.
In panel B, we estimate country-level regressions of two mental health indices and a public
attitude misperception index on four different indicators of perceptions of government response,
for a total of 12 separate regressions. Each regression has the following form:

Yc = α + β ∗ Pc + γ ∗ Xc + c

(1)

where Yc is the outcome of interest in country c – either the average worries index, the average
depression index, or the average misperception index. The coefficient of interest that is displayed in panel b) is β, which is estimated in a separate regression for each outcome variable: i)
the share of respondents who perceive government response as insufficient, ii) the share of respondents who perceive public response as insufficient, iii) the share of respondents who think
the government has been truthful, and iv) the share of respondents who trust their country’s
government. Xc is a vector of control variables consisting of the country-level means of i) the
day-to-day change (∆) in Covid-19 cases per capita, ii) the day-to-day change (∆) in Covid-19
27

deaths per capita, and iii) the number of Covid-19 deaths per capita. In each regression, standard errors are robust and the countries are weighted by their population. The tabular versions
of these results are presented in Table 3.
In panel C, we run country-day-level regressions of seven different outcome variables on an
index of government restrictions, for a total of seven separate regressions. Each regression has
the following form:

Ycd = α + β ∗ Rcd + γ ∗ Xcd + νc + νd + cd

(2)

where Ycd is the outcome of interest in country c on day d – i) the share of respondents who
perceive government response as insufficient, ii) the share of respondents who think the government has been truthful, iii) the share of respondents who trust their country’s government, iv)
the share of respondents who perceive public response as insufficient, v) the average misperception index, vi) the average worries index, and vii) the average depression index. The coefficient
of interest that is displayed in panel c) is β, which is estimated for the country’s daily general
restriction index Rcd . Xcd is a vector of control variables consisting of the country-day means
of i) the day-to-day change (∆) in Covid-19 cases per capita, ii) the day-to-day change (∆) in
Covid-19 deaths per capita, and iii) the number of Covid-19 deaths per capita. νc and νd are
country and day fixed effects. In each regression, standard errors are robust and the countries
are weighted by their population. The tabular version of these results are presented in Panel A
of Table 4.
In panel D, we run a similar analysis to panel c), however on individual-level data. In this
difference-in-difference analysis, we compare respondents in the UK to non-UK respondents,
pre- and post-UK-lockdown. We estimate the following regressions for all individuals from
countries with at least 5000 respondents who took the survey between the 20th and 30th March
2020:
28

Yi = β ∗ Li + γ ∗ Xi + νe + νa + νd + i

(3)

where Yi is the outcome of interest of individual i – i) whether the respondent perceives
government response as insufficient, ii) whether the respondent thinks the government has been
truthful, iii) whether the respondent trusts their country’s government, iv) whether the respondent perceives public response as insufficient, v) the individual-level misperception index, vi)
the individual-level worries index, and vii) the individual-level depression index. The coefficient of interest that is displayed in panel d) is β, which is estimated for an indicator variable Li
taking the value of one if the respondent’s country is the UK and the response day is after the
announcement of UK’s lockdown on the evening of March 23rd, and zero otherwise.4 Xi is a
vector of individual-level control variables consisting of the respondent’s country’s daily means
of i) the day-to-day change (∆) in Covid-19 cases per capita, ii) the day-to-day change (∆) in
Covid-19 deaths per capita, iii) the number of Covid-19 cases per capita, and iv) the number of
Covid-19 deaths per capita. νe , νa and νd are country-education, country-age-gender and day
fixed effects. In each regression, standard errors are clustered by country-age and gender of the
respondents. The tabular version of these results are presented in Panel B of Table 4.
Panels e) and f) display event studies for the UK lockdown, estimated on individual-level
data between March 20th and 30th.

Weight Construction

This section describes the construction and use of weights included with the survey data. The
included weights correct for differences in income, education, and age and gender structure
between survey respondents and the general population in each country. For countries that lack
data on one of the dimensions, the weights correct for the available dimensions.
We use data on the population structure from the United Nations statistical agency to construct the weights.5 To weight by income we use data from the Gallup World Poll.6
Table 5 displays the age-gender bins used for reweighting to account for the population
structure. This definition means that we cannot construct weights for respondents who indicate
‘other’ as gender. To construct income weights, we use country-level income quintiles. Finally,
we use three education categories to construct weights: less than 8 years of education, between
nine and 14 years of education, and 15 and more years of education.
These age bins are then used to construct weights based on the frequency of observations in
the survey data according to the following formula:

j weightibc =

weightjb · Nc
Njb

(5)

where j weightibc is the weight for individual i in bin b, for category j (age-gender, income,
education), and country c. weightjb is the fraction of the population in bin b of category j. Njb is
the number of individuals in our survey in bin b and Nc is the number of observations in country
c. Intuitively, this formula put more weight on individuals in in bins with few observations and
individuals in larger bins.
To construct aggregate individual-level weights we multiply the weights in different cate5
6

The data can be accessed here: http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode%3A22 .
We use the latest available wave of data for each country.

32

gories.7

weightijbc = Πj∈(educ,inc,ag) j weightibc

(6)

We also construct weights that account for the differential sample size across countries
(weighting all countries equally) by dividing the weights by the number of observations in
our sample.

weight sampleijbc = weightijbc /Nc

Robustness of findings

G.1

Group-level analysis

In this Appendix, we report the results of an exercise that highlights the level of uniformity in
attitudes towards social distancing measures and towards the broader government responses to
the COVID-19 pandemic. We proceed in two steps. We first split our data by country, gender,
median income, and median age. This produces 464 distinct social groups (with group size
ranging from N=2636 to N=15). Second, for each question, we sort the groups by their average
response and then plot them in Figure 6. In Figure 7 we show the same graph, but with dot sizes
proportional to the number of observations per subgroup. Finally, we repeat the same exercise
exercise using the representative data for the UK and US (Figure 8).
This exercise shows a remarkable level of uniformity in attitudes towards social distancing
and the broader government response to the pandemic. We are unable to find a single social
group where the majority of individuals think that the reaction of their government has been
excessive. Similarly, there is no social group where a majority of individuals believe that social
distancing measures are not effective.

Robustness of UK case study

In this Appendix we show that the UK case study results are robust to (i) using a different set of
counterfactual and to accounting for differential selection into the survey over time. The results
of both analysis support the conclusions of the analysis presented in the main paper.

Varying counterfactuals

For the main analysis we use a set of four countries (Germany, Swe-

den, the United States, and Brazil) as control group in the difference-in-differences estimation.
The results of this analysis are displayed in Table 6. The main results on “Government reaction
insufficient” are extremely robust to the choice of counterfactiual. Further results are qualita34

tively similar for almost all specifications, though some estimates are more noisily estimated
and not always statistically significant.

Notes: Notes: Coefficient estimates represent the estimated treatment effect of the announcement of a lockdown in
the UK as described in SI-E using different countries with more than 5000 responses as counterfactual. Columns
indicate the country of comparison. Rows indicate the dependent variable. Heteroskedasticity robust standard
errors are displayed in parenthesis. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Time varying selection into the survey Another potential concern is that the selection into
the survey changed over time. This change in the composition of respondents could lead to
differential answers to the survey that are not related to the announcement of the lockdown
in the UK. To alleviate this concern, we reconstruct all weights based on the samples before
35

and after the lockdown announcement. Figure 3 shows that the main effects on perceptions of
government and the public are robust to accounting for differential selection over time in this
way. The effect on the worries index becomes somewhat muted when including these weights.

This figure presents the country averages for the perceptions about the governemnts and the public’s reaction to COVID-19. Countries are
included if they contributed at least 200 respondents. Individual observations were reweighted by education, gender, age and income to render
them representative at the country-level.

This figure shows subgroup averages of individual perceptions of (i) whether the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been
excessive and (ii) whether social distancing is effective. The sample includes respondents from countries for which we have at least 200
responses (N = 107, 565). To produce the figure, we first split the sample into 464 subgroups based on country, gender, median age and
median income. We then calculate average perceptions in each subgroup, order the subgroups by their average perception, and plot these
values in the figure.

Notes: This figure shows descriptive statistics of personal and perceptions of societal reactions to COVID-19. Panel A presents self-reported
engagement in protective behavior. Panel B contrasts respondents’ attitudes and perceived attitudes of compatriots about protective behaviors
and policies. Panel C shows the share of respondents who think that the government action has been excessive by country. Panel D displays
cross-country variation in perceptions of sufficiency of government and public reactions to COVID-19 and of trust in and perceived
truthfulness of governments. The sample was collected using snowball sampling from March 20th to April 6th 2020 (N = 107, 565).
Respondents from countries with at least 200 responses are included. Responses are weighted to be representative at the country level in terms
of age, gender, income, and education. Panel A and B are further weighted by country population to account for different country sizes. Panel
C and D display weighted country averages.

Notes: All indices are defined and described in SI-C regressions are further described in SI-E. Respondents from countries with at least 200 responses are included. Panel A shows the
cross-country relationship between the share of respondents perceiving their government’s response as insufficient and a worries index. Panel B captures pairwise relationship between the
variables indicated in the figure heading and row across countries. The regressions in Panel C are estimated using the country x date weighted average data, controlling for country and
day fixed effects; the independent variable is an index of strictness of government response in a country. The regressions in Panel D are estimated using the individual-level data from the
UK and a set of control group countries. The regressions control for country-by-education-by-gender fixed effects and date fixed effects. The independent variable is an indicator variable
taking the value 1 for respondents participating from the UK after the 23 March 2020. Panels E and F illustrate the impact of the UK lockdown announcement among respondents from
the UK compared to the average time trend among participants from control group countries on perceptions of sufficiency of the government response and the worries index. The
underlying data is the survey data that was collected using snowball sampling from March 20th to April 6th 2020 (N= 107,565).
