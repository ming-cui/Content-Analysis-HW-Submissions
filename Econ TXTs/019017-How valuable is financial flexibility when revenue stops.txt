How Valuable is Financial Flexibility when Revenue Stops? Evidence from the COVID-19
Crisis

ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 shock creates a sudden temporary sharp shortfall in revenue for firms. We expect
firms with greater financial flexibility to be better able to fund themselves in the presence of a revenue
shortfall and to benefit less from the news concerning policy responses to the crisis on March 24. We
show that firms with less financial flexibility experience worse stock returns until March 23 and benefit
more from the news on March 24. Specifically, we find that firms with high financial flexibility experience
a stock price drop lower by 26% or 9.7 percentage points than those with low financial flexibility.
Similar results hold for CDS spreads. Had firms not made payouts over the last three years, the stock
price drop for a firm with an average payout over assets ratio would have been lower by less than 2
percentage points. If firms in the top quartile of payouts over assets for the last three years did not
have payouts over that period, they could, on average, have repaid all their long-term debt and their
stock price drop would have been lower by 5.1 percentage points. Existing measures of financial constraints
are not helpful in explaining the reaction of firms to the shock.

1. Introduction.
The COVID-19 crisis is “the textbook example of an exogenous shock.” 1 For corporations, it causes a
sudden stop in some or all of their revenue production. Firms differ in how their financial affairs are
organized. Some firms hold large amounts of cash to help them cope with unexpected events. They also
keep debt capacity and limit their exposure to debt rollover risk. These firms have financial flexibility, so
that they can fund more easily their cash flow shortfall. Financial economics tells us that an adverse
exogenous shock should affect such firms less. Firms with less financial flexibility might rapidly be in
financial distress and forced to take actions that healthy firms would consider detrimental to long-term
shareholder wealth.
In this paper, we investigate how a firm’s financial flexibility affects its stock price and credit risk
reactions to the COVID-19 shock. We first analyze whether financial flexibility is valuable and by how
much using firms’ stock performance from February 3 to March 23, which we call the collapse period.
Second, we ask whether more financially flexible firms benefitted relatively less from the news on policy
responses that led to a dramatic positive move of the stock market on March 24, a day we call stimulus day.
We expect the change in expectations about policies to affect firms with more financial flexibility less if
these firms are affected less by the crisis. Further, these firms are less dependent on the financial system
working smoothly, so that steps to reduce stress in the financial system should affect them less.
We find evidence supportive of the role of financial flexibility. Specifically, firms with more long-term
debt perform worse during the collapse period and gain more on stimulus day. We also find evidence of
benefits from cash holdings and costs associated with short-term debt, but that evidence is not as strong.
When we compare highly financially flexible firms to firms with low flexibility, we find that the stock price
of highly flexible firms fell by 26% less than the stock price of firms with low flexibility; we also show that
the CDS premiums of highly flexible firms increased by 176 basis points less than the CDS premiums of
firms with low flexibility. A way for firms to increase financial flexibility is through greater retention of

cash flow (e.g., DeAngelo, Gonçalves, and Stulz, 2018). We find, however, that had firms not had payouts
in the last three years, their financial flexibility would not have been very different on average and their
average improvement in stock returns would have been smaller than 2%. Eliminating payouts would have
had a greater impact on returns for the firms with high payouts over assets ratios. Though the financial
economics literature has devoted much attention to whether firms are financially constrained, we find that
popular measures of financial constraints are not helpful in understanding firms’ reaction to the COVID-19
shock.
A large body of literature examines the impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on firms (e.g.,
Almeida et al., 2011; Campello, Graham, and Harvey, 2010; Chodorow-Reich, 2014; Duchin, Ozbas, and
Sensoy, 2010; Giroud and Mueller, 2017; Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010; Kahle and Stulz, 2013). Much of
that literature focuses on how the GFC affected firms through its impact on the ability of financial
intermediaries to perform their function, but some studies also show that the impact of the GFC is mediated
by firms’ balance sheet strength. The COVID-19 crisis differs in a fundamental way from the GFC. Though
March 2020 and September 2008 look similar, in that they involve a rapid collapse in stock prices and
unprecedented interventions by the Federal Reserve, the most dramatic period of the GFC originated in the
financial sector with the collapse of Lehman. In contrast, the COVID-19 crisis starts outside the financial
sector. The immediate real effects of the COVID-19 crisis are far more dramatic than the immediate real
effects of the GFC as many firms experience a sudden stop in their ability to produce and earn. Typical
macroeconomic indicators plunge more in April 2020 than they did in the worst month of the GFC.
However, the COVID-19 crisis evolves into a period with a stressed financial system in March as various
financial markets seize up.
By its nature, the COVID-19 shock represents a loss of cash flow of indeterminate duration for firms.
We define financial flexibility as the ease with which a firm can fund a cash flow shortfall. If a firm is
hampered in funding its cash flow shortfall, it has to alter what otherwise would be optimal production and
investment policies to generate cash. For instance, it has to postpone investment and find ways to cut costs.
A firm that has the highest level of financial flexibility has no difficulty in funding a cash flow shortfall.
2

An example of such a firm would be an all-equity firm with plentiful liquidity. Such a firm can fund a cash
flow shortfall from its own liquid assets and does not face risks associated with debt payments or debt
rollover. It will not have to raise funds quickly to cope with a momentary decrease in revenues. Less
financially flexible firms have to devote resources to raise funds because of the shock, have to pay more
for these funds while the financial system is stressed, and if unable to procure such funds, have to find other
ways to generate cash flows, such as suboptimal cost reductions and cuts in their investment programs.
Therefore, we expect less financially flexible firms to experience a greater loss in the value of their equity
than otherwise similar firms that are more financially flexible.
After the Senate voted no on a vote related to the stimulus package on March 22, the status of that
package was unclear. 2 On March 22, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
took dramatic actions designed to relieve the stress in the financial system that it communicated in detail
on March 23 before the opening of the markets. 3 The Fed stated that it would buy Treasuries “in the amounts
needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader
financial conditions and the economy” and opened new facilities designed to provide credit to employers
and to support the corporate bond market. These steps went beyond what the Fed did in 2008. Yet, on the
23rd, the stock market fell. It is only on the 24th, after the market learned that approval of a stimulus package
was now likely, that the stock market responded positively with the best one-day performance since 2008. 4
We expect that the firms with more financial flexibility are affected less by these policy changes and
investigate how financial flexibility affects the impact of stimulus day on firms’ stock prices.
For our analyses, we construct a sample of non-financial firms. For each firm for which fiscal year-end
2019 accounting information is available, we measure the cumulative return on its stock for the collapse
period. This return measures the impact of the shock on the firm’s shareholders. We estimate regressions
of the stock return on determinants of the stock return and variables that proxy for financial flexibility. We

consider a firm more financially flexible if it holds more cash, has less debt due within a year, and has less
leverage measured by long-term debt over assets. We then estimate regressions of the stock returns on the
same variables on stimulus day.
We find strong evidence that firms with more financial flexibility are less affected by the COVID-19
shock during the collapse period. These firms also benefit less on stimulus day. Specifically, controlling
for known determinants of stock returns, we find that firms with less short-term debt, more cash, and less
long-term debt experience a lower stock price drop in response to the shock. However, among these
variables, the ratio of long-term debt to assets is most consistently significant. We expect that firms with
relatively more short-term debt to be more affected by the shock as they have to refinance more debt in the
short-run when the financial system may be stressed. Yet, we find typically no difference between the
coefficient on short-term debt and the coefficient on long-term debt.
Because investment programs tend to be sticky, financial flexibility could be more valuable for firms
with high capital expenditures and high R&D expenditures. The relation between stock returns and capital
expenditures seems sensitive to the specification. We see no evidence that firms with larger R&D
expenditures experience a larger stock-price drop. Firms with more variable costs should be affected less
by a temporary revenue shortfall because they can scale down their operations more easily. We find some
evidence that firms for which, everything else equal, costs of goods sold (COGS), a measure of variable
costs, are more important are affected less. In contrast, firms with more selling, general, and administrative
(SG&A) expenses, a measure more dependent on fixed costs, are affected more. Corporate diversification
could help firms to cope better with an adverse shock as internal capital markets can substitute for external
capital markets. Some studies found that diversified companies were affected less by the GFC (Matvos and
Seru, 2014; Kuppuswamy and Villalonga, 2016). We find no evidence that conglomerates performed better
during the collapse period.
The CARES Act voted by Congress limits repurchases by corporations. In the public debate on the Act,
there was much discussion that corporations would have been more resilient had they had lower payouts in

4

previous years. 5 Many observers have expressed concerns that large payouts have led firms to have balance
sheets that provide them with an insufficient cushion against adverse events. As John Plender put it in the
Financial Times, “Woe betide anyone who is going into this virus-induced global recession with an efficient
balance sheet.” 6 Logically, if firms had lower payouts in the past, they would have been more financially
flexible. We investigate whether firms with more payouts in the past experience a larger stock drop and a
worsening of their creditworthiness, using 2019 payouts over assets. Surprisingly, there is no statistically
significant relation between past payouts and stock returns during the collapse whether we control for our
financial flexibility proxies or not. The same result holds for CDS premiums. A straightforward explanation
is that if firms had not made payouts in 2019 and had instead increased their cash holdings or decreased
long-term debt, the impact for the average firm would have been small. It is possible that more than last
year’s payouts matter. We find similar results when we use the cumulative payouts over the last three years
instead of the payouts in 2019. However, the payout policy of firms with high cumulative payouts over
assets for the three years ending in 2019 has a substantial impact on their financial flexibility on average.
Specifically, when we consider the firms that are in the top quartile of the distribution of the ratio of threeyear cumulative payouts over assets in 2019, we find that the ratio of payouts over assets for such firms is
roughly comparable to their ratio of long-term debt to assets. Consequently, if these firms had not had
dividends and repurchases, they could have bought back all their long-term debt. Had they done so, their
stock returns during the collapse period would have been 5.1 percentage points higher.
Many studies explore whether financial constraints have real effects on firms. One of the most cited
studies of the impact of the GFC on firms investigates how the crisis affected the extent to which they were
financially constrained and how these constraints led them to cut back their spending plans (Campello,
Graham, and Harvey, 2010). Financial economists have devoted considerable energy to construct measures
of the extent to which a firm is financially constrained. Popular measures of financial constraints include

Journal, March 25, 2020.

whether a firm has a credit rating, the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index, the Whited and Wu (2006) index,
and the SA index of Hadlock and Pierce (2010). We investigate whether firms judged to be more financially
constrained according to these well-known indices or firms that lack a credit rating have worse stock returns
during the collapse period. We find no evidence that they do. A firm that is financially constrained in that
it cannot access outside finance may have accumulated large holdings of cash internally to cope with
unexpected shocks (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach, 2004; Opler et al., 1999). Hence, such a firm may
be able cope with a cash flow shock better than a firm that has access to financial markets but has low cash
holdings and is highly levered. Interestingly, a measure developed by Huang and Ritter (2019) of how much
a firm would need to access outside funding if it spent as much as in the previous year is useful. We show
that firms that would run out of cash without accessing outside funding are more affected by the shock.
We also investigate how firms’ creditworthiness is affected by the COVID-19 crisis using credit default
swap (CDS) premiums. CDS premiums are a frequently used measure of creditworthiness as a firm’s CDS
premium corresponds to the cost of insuring against default losses for that firm. Not surprisingly, CDS
premiums increase sharply during the collapse period. We find strong evidence that more levered firms
experience stronger increases in CDS premiums, but no evidence that firms with larger cash holdings have
lower increases in CDS premiums. Again, there is no evidence that firms with more short-term debt are
affected differently from firms with more long-term debt. Importantly, firms with more fixed costs appear
to see their CDS premiums increase more.
Three important caveats for our study are in order. First, we focus on how markets react to news about
the COVID-19 crisis and how that reaction differs across firms that differ in financial flexibility. Markets
make mistakes. They can be inefficient. They can overreact and underreact. Firm-level idiosyncratic
mistakes make it harder for us to find evidence of a role for financial flexibility. Second, there can be costs
to financial flexibility. For instance, as shown in Jensen (1986) and Stulz (1990), agency costs can be higher
for firms with greater financial flexibility. We do not address these costs in this study. Third, we ignore
general equilibrium effects. For instance, when we make a statement about how stock returns of firms would

6

have been affected had these firms not made payouts for the last three years, we ignore that the market’s
stock price drop would have been different as a result.
Our paper contributes to several literatures. We only discuss here its contributions to two key literatures.
First, we add to the literature on the benefits and costs of financial flexibility. As pointed out by Denis
(2011, p. 667), this “literature encompasses studies of the determinants and consequences of corporate cash
holdings, as well as the impact of flexibility considerations on corporate capital structure and payout
policies.” Graham and Harvey (2001) find that financial flexibility is the single most important determinant
of capital structure for CFOs. DeAngelo and DeAngelo (2007) show that when financial flexibility is
valuable, ex ante low leverage is optimal because it gives firms the option to lever up later when they have
to do so. Our paper provides evidence on the value of flexibility when a firm is affected by a large and
unexpected revenue shock, which is the type of situation for which firms have precautionary cash holdings
and keep financial flexibility.
Second, the paper contributes to the literature on how corporate balance sheets affect the transmission
of shocks. A vast literature in macroeconomics building on Bernanke and Gertler (1989) shows how the
impact of shocks is magnified for firms with weaker balance sheets. The finance literature has shown that
firms with weaker balance sheets at the start of the GFC were affected more by the crisis (Kahle and Stulz,
2013) and that firm balance sheets were important in the propagation of the GFC (Giroud and Mueller,
2017). In this literature, it is typically difficult to find shocks that are fully unanticipated. As a result, a
firm’s finances may be organized in a way that the firm finds optimal to deal with partially anticipated
shocks. This issue does not arise here. There is no reason to believe that the balance sheets and income
statements of firms at the end of fiscal year 2019 were in any way affected by anticipations of a risk of a
COVID-19 crisis. Part of this literature focuses more directly on short-term debt and rollover risks, in
particular showing that firms that had to roll over debt early in 2007 fared less well (Almeida et al., 2011).
Contemporaneous work on firms and the COVID-19 crisis includes Ramelli and Wagner (2020), who
examine stock-price reactions of US firms to the COVID-19 crisis since January 2020, with a focus on their
international and China exposure, but they also show a negative relation between stock returns and leverage
7

and a positive relation between cash and stock returns. Albuquerque et al. (2020) use U.S. data to show that
firms with high environmental and social ratings had better returns during the first quarter of 2020, even
after controlling for cash (positive effect on returns) and leverage (negative effect on returns). De Vito and
Gómez (2020) use an international sample and simulations to analyze how much time firms with limited
operating flexibility would have before they exhaust cash reserves. Using a large international sample, Ding
et al. (2020) examine the connection between stronger pre-2020 finances, less exposure to COVID-19
through global supply chains, more CSR activities, and better corporate governance and the stock price
reactions to COVID-19 cases. In contrast to these studies, our focus is on evaluating existing finance
theories concerning the role of financial flexibility, in assessing the importance of financial flexibility in
mitigating the impact of the shock, and in evaluating how flexibility would have been different had firms
had lower payouts. Loughran and McDonald (2020) examine risk disclosures of companies and find that
79% of companies had no pandemic risk disclosure in 2018. Hassan et al. (2020) use text-based measures
of the costs and benefits associated with the spread of COVID-19 and find that most firms are concerned
with a sudden drop in demand and disrupted supply chains but not with financial constraints. Eldar and
Wittry (2020) show that a surprising number of firms adopt poison pills during the crisis.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we derive the hypotheses we investigate and relate them
to the existing literature. We present our sample in Section 3 and compare stock performance and
characteristics for firms in directly impacted industries versus other industries. In Section 4, we investigate
how stock returns differ across firms with different degrees of financial flexibility. In Section 5, we examine
the relation between flexibility, payouts, and stock returns during the collapse period in greater detail. We
also provide evidence on the role of corporate diversification during the collapse period. In Section 6, we
relate stock returns to measures of financial constraints. In Section 7, we investigate how financial
flexibility affects changes in CDS premiums during the collapse period as well as on stimulus day. We
conclude in Section 8.

2. Financial economics and sudden temporary revenue stops.
In this section, we make predictions about the impact of a sudden temporary revenue stop, using the
existing financial economics literature. We investigate our predictions empirically in the subsequent
sections. We start with two extreme benchmarks. The first one is the traditional perfect markets benchmark
and the second is the case of binding financial constraints. We then address scenarios where a firm’s
financial situation is between these two extreme benchmarks.

2.a. Perfect markets: All-equity firm.
Consider the simplest case of perfect markets where a firm earns every month revenue 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 and incurs

costs 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 , so that its net operating cash flow 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 is equal to 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 . The total cash flow of the firm is 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 −
𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 , where 𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡 are investment expenses. For now, we assume that the costs are fixed, so that the firm still has

to pay them if production stops. To simplify the discussion, we also assume that the firm has no investment

expenses. Let 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 be the value of the firm at time t. Assume that time t cash flows are discounted to today

using the discount factor 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡). With these assumptions, we have the following expression for the value 𝑆𝑆0
of an all-equity firm: 7

∞

𝑆𝑆0 = � 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝐸𝐸0 (𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 )

where 𝐸𝐸0 (…) is the expectation operator.

(1)

𝑡𝑡=1

Suppose now that the firm learns that its revenue will fall to zero for n months and then will resume at

the level expected at time zero. For now, we assume that the discount factors are unchanged. In this case,
using a superscript STOP to denote the value of the equity with a sudden temporary stop in revenue, the
value of equity becomes:
𝑆𝑆0STOP

7

𝑛𝑛

∞

𝑡𝑡=1

𝑡𝑡=𝑛𝑛+1

= � 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝐸𝐸0 (−𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 ) + � 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝐸𝐸0 (𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 )

Equation (1) is simply equation 2.20 of Fama and Miller (1972) with the assumptions we have made.

9

(2)

With this scenario, the loss from the sudden stop is the cumulative loss in revenue. If the firm’s costs
are unaffected, the firm still has to pay its costs for n months without receiving any revenue. In this simple
setup, the value of the equity falls by the cumulative loss of expected revenue over n months. With perfect
markets, the firm can borrow against future income to pay its costs as long as the present value of future
cash flows exceeds the present value of the costs it has to pay during the n months. The collateral for its
borrowing is the value of the firm after the end of the momentary revenue stop. If the present value of the
costs to be paid over n months exceeds the present value of the cash flows after the end of the n months,
the firm has no value and liquidates. Therefore, the loss in equity value assuming the firm has value after
the shock is:
𝑆𝑆0 −𝑆𝑆0STOP

𝑛𝑛

= � 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝐸𝐸0 (𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 )

(3)

𝑡𝑡=1

Whether equity is wiped out or not depends on the length of the sudden stop. It also depends on the
profitability of the firm. To see this, note that the firm has to finance the costs it still incurs. For given
revenue, the lower the costs, the less the firm has to finance. Further, for given revenue, the value of the
firm after the end of the sudden shock is negatively related to costs, so that the lower the costs, the greater
the collateral against which to borrow.
Note that firm value after the end of the sudden stop could be lower for at least two reasons. First, the
event that causes the sudden stop could also affect the discount factors. In a crisis period, the risk-free rate
can fall as investors become more risk-averse and the firm’s risk premium, measured as the difference
between the firm’s expected stock return and the risk-free rate, can increase. If the risk premium increases
sufficiently, the firm experiences an increase in discount rates, and it becomes more likely that the firm will
be liquidated as the present value of the cash flows it will receive after the n months of no revenue is lower.
Second, we assume that the firm’s cash flows after n months are the same as what they would have been
absent the shock. If that is not the case and the cash flows are lower for some period of time, the present
value of the firm after the end of the sudden revenue stop is lower and the firm is again more likely to be
liquidated.
10

So far, we have assumed that all the costs are fixed. When its revenue disappears, the firm still has to
pay all its costs, so that the cost of the shock is the present value of the disappeared revenue. Obviously, in
general, firms have variable costs in addition to their fixed costs. If the firm does not produce for some
period of time, it can save the variable costs. Consider the extreme case where all costs are variable, so that
if the firm does not produce it does not incur any costs. Such a firm has low operating leverage. In this case,
the firm just loses its discounted expected net cash flow over n months, and its value with the shock is:
𝑆𝑆0STOP

∞

= � 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝐸𝐸0 (𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 − 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 )

(4)

𝑡𝑡=𝑛𝑛+1

With only variable costs, the all-equity firm would never go out of business because of a temporary sudden
stop. The firm would go to sleep and wake up n months from now.
In general, a firm has some costs it has to pay even if it does not produce. In this case, the extent of the
loss from the sudden stop depends on the firm’s ability to reduce its costs while it is not producing. With
decreasing operating leverage, the firm moves from equation (2) towards equation (4). The less operating
leverage it has, the less it loses from the sudden shock.
We assume in the analysis that during the sudden stop the revenue falls to zero. We do so for simplicity.
Allowing revenue to fall only partially leads to the possibility that revenue falls so little that the firm is still
profitable during the stop. In that case, the firm never liquidates. If revenue falls so that the firm is not
profitable during the stop, the analysis is the same as if revenue goes to zero.

2.b. Perfect markets: Levered firm.
Suppose now the firm has debt. For simplicity, assume that the firm owes a constant debt payment each
month forever. With perfect markets, these debt payments simply correspond to an increase in costs.
Equations (1) through (4) are still correct for the value of equity as long as that value is positive. Greater
debt payments mean that the loss to equity from the shock is higher because, everything else equal, the
firm’s fixed costs are higher. Greater debt payments also imply that it is more likely that the firm liquidates
because the firm has less collateral it can use to fund its costs. If we compare two identical firms except one
11

has debt and the other does not, the value of the equity of the firm with debt falls proportionately more in
response to the shock.
Lastly, we can distinguish between short-term debt and long-term debt. For simplicity, assume that
short-term debt is debt with payments only during the sudden stop and long-term debt is debt with payments
only after the sudden stop. With our assumption of perfect markets, provided that the present value of the
debt payments is the same, it does not matter whether the debt is short-term or long-term as long as the firm
is solvent. If the debt is only short-term, the firm has to borrow more to fund the cash flow shortfall, but
since it does not have long-term debt the value of the collateral that can be used to borrow is higher.
Alternatively, if the debt is only long-term, the firm borrows less because its costs during the sudden stop
are lower but it has less collateral to borrow because its costs after the sudden stop are higher.

2.c. The case of a financially constrained firm.
Consider now a firm that is financially constrained in that it cannot raise outside finance. Nothing else
changes from the earlier discussion in sections 2.a and 2.b, which makes the existence of financial
constraints somewhat arbitrary. In general, financial constraints arise from frictions that make markets
imperfect. To keep the analysis simple and to show starkly the implications of a sudden temporary revenue
stop for a firm that cannot access outside funding, we do not model the frictions that cause the firm to be
financially constrained.
In the financially constrained firm case, a firm that does not have financial resources to fund its costs
has to liquidate even if that firm is still highly valuable unless it can sell assets. It is well-known that selling
assets can provide firms with funding (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny, 1992), but it is also well-known that during
a crisis selling assets may entail fire sale discounts (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny, 2011) and hence is an
expensive form of funding. With the simple firm we consider, shareholders could sell a fraction of the firm
large enough to fund the cash flow shortfall. With perfect markets, there would be no firesale discount.
With market imperfections, such a discount would be likely, so that the cost to the shareholders would
increase by the fire sale discount.
12

A firm that is financially constrained would not put itself in a position where a revenue shortfall that
leaves the firm valuable absent financial constraints either puts it out of business or forces it to sell assets.
Generally, firms that are financially constrained invest in cash holdings so that they have a cash buffer if
they face a shortfall in revenues (Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach, 2004). Consider a financially
constrained firm with fixed costs and a fixed cash buffer. Further, assume that the firm cannot liquidate to
avoid paying fixed costs and cannot sell assets. In this case, if the buffer is large enough to enable the firm
to not fail during the n months that it cannot produce, the firm will use the cash buffer to pay its costs. If
the buffer is not large enough and the firm cannot sell assets, the firm has to liquidate during the period
without revenue. With any type of uncertainty, the firm would wait to liquidate until it has exhausted its
cash buffer as it is always possible that things could improve enough to avoid liquidation. Shareholders
would never gain by liquidating early.
It follows from our analysis that, for a financially constrained firm, the size of the cash buffer is crucial.
A buffer that is too low forces the firm to sell assets or liquidate. It could also force the firm to attempt to
reduce costs in ways that are inefficient. For instance, the firm might stop investments that are worthwhile,
or reduce maintenance expenses.

2.d. Between the benchmarks.
The typical firm is one that faces frictions in raising funds, but is not in a situation where it cannot raise
funds. As a result, external finance is costly for such a firm and it becomes more costly as it has less
collateral to make available to raise outside funds (e.g., Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen, 1988). Agency
costs and information asymmetries are reasons why outside finance is costly and these costs increase as
firms become more highly levered. For such a firm, cash will be a cheaper source of funding than external
funding. The firm will also have cheaper funding if it has more collateral available to raise funds. If the
firm is diversified, the availability of an internal capital market means that it can fund some activities
without having to resort to external funding, so that the internal capital market of a diversified firm can
mitigate the impact of the sudden revenue stop.
13

A typical firm will have access to outside funding, so that it will resort to asset sales only in extreme
cases. Such a firm is negatively affected if outside funding becomes more costly and/or difficult. The extent
to which it is affected depends in part on how urgent its need for funding is. A firm that is financially
flexible has ample cash holdings, so that it can wait to raise funds externally. It can avoid having to raise
external finance when markets are stressed. It will also be in a position where it has debt capacity so that it
can raise external funds easily and at a low cost.

2.e. Predictions.
We derive the following testable hypotheses from our analysis in sections 2.a to 2.d:
Hypothesis 1. Financial flexibility and equity value. Stock prices fall when the market learns about
a momentary sudden revenue stop. The greater the financial flexibility of a firm, everything else equal, the
smaller the stock price drop. Given financial flexibility, the stock-price drop is less for firms that are better
able to cut costs. The value of financial flexibility is higher when the financial system is more stressed.
Everything else equal, measures that reduce the stress in the financial system benefit firms with low
financial flexibility more.
Easier access to outside finance should make it easier for a firm to finance its cash-flow shortfall if
there is a temporary sudden stop of revenue. In this case, the following result holds:
Hypothesis 2. Financial constraints. More financially constrained firms experience worse equity
returns in response to a temporary sudden revenue stop.
A simple reason why this hypothesis might not hold is that the existing measures of financial constraints
are such that a firm could have large cash holdings and appear to be financially constrained. Yet, such a
firm might be in a good position to fund itself when there is a temporary sudden revenue stop.
Lastly, we turn to the implications of the analysis for a firm’s credit risk. Our analysis so far in this
section uses a simple model. Deriving the implications for a firm’s credit risk formally would take us
beyond the scope of this paper. However, an investigation of credit spreads makes it possible to consider
some additional implications of financial flexibility. As we show, the sudden revenue stop decreases firm
14

value. If the firm is levered and if its debt is risky, we expect the debt to lose value because of the decrease
in firm value. However, the implications of the sudden revenue stop for the short-term probability of default
of a firm depend very much on the time schedule of debt payments of the firm. Suppose that a firm is highly
levered but the debt is zero-coupon debt that matures in twenty years. Such a firm is not at risk of defaulting
in the short-run. In contrast, suppose that a firm has moderate leverage but all of the debt matures in six
months when it has to be rolled over. The firm might default in six months because it cannot roll over its
debt. It could be that the value of the firm is too low, so that there is not enough collateral to roll over the
debt. Alternatively, the financial system could be sufficiently stressed that the firm cannot access outside
funding. It follows that:
Hypothesis 3. Financial flexibility and credit spreads. A firm’s credit spread increases with a sudden
revenue stop if the debt is risky. Everything else equal, it increases more if the debt is short-term and if the
firm has less cash, is more highly levered, has more fixed costs, and has less variable costs.

3. Data and sample summary statistics.
In this section, we describe how we construct our sample, the characteristics of sample firms, and the
performance of firms during our sample period.
We focus on firms for which 2019 fiscal year-end data is available from Compustat at the time of
writing. We drop financial firms, utilities, not for profit and governmental firms, and firms with non-U.S.
headquarters.
We obtain stock market data from Compustat’s CapitalIQ North America Daily database. We remove
stocks with prices of less than $1, and those with a security type not equal to “common, ordinary”. After
these additional filters, our final sample consists of 1,857 firms. Details on the sample selection process and
on how many firms we drop due to each filter are in Appendix A.
Additional data and their source are the one-month treasury rate (St. Louis Federal Reserve) and
midquotes of five-year maturity Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads (Standard and Poor’s CapitalIQ
database). We use the Compustat Segments database to classify firms as conglomerates.
15

We consider firms to be more financially flexible if they hold more cash, have less short-term debt, and
have less long-term debt. Table 1, Panel A, shows that the average firm has cash over assets of 22.4%.
Median cash over assets is 11.2%. The difference between the mean and the median of cash over assets is
not surprising as the distribution of cash holdings is skewed. The typical firm has little short-term debt,
where short-term debt is defined as debt that matures within 2020, as the median short-term debt over assets
is only 1.3%. We compute net short-term debt, which is short-term debt in excess of cash. Both median and
mean net short-term debt over assets are negative, so that the median and the average firm hold more cash
than short-term debt. Long-term debt is much more substantial as mean long-term debt over assets is 27.9%
and median long-term debt over assets is 25.9%. The average payout ratio, defined as dividends plus
repurchases over assets, is 0.035. As a comparison, Kahle and Stulz (2020) calculate an average net payout
over assets ratio of 0.048 for US firms between 2010 and 2017.
We also consider a subset of firms in industries more directly affected by the COVID-19 shock. We
call the industries that are more directly affected the COVID-19 industries. We use the industries described
in OECD (2020) as those most affected by the shock and not our own definition, to reduce concerns about
data mining. Moody’s (2020) classifies some industries as highly exposed and these industries match our
COVID-19 industries. Those industries are, using the 49 Fama-French industry definitions, Entertainment,
Construction, Automobiles and trucks, Aircraft, Ships, Personal services, Transportation, Wholesale,
Retail, and Restaurants, hotels and motels. Panel B of Table 1 shows the characteristics of firms in the
COVID-19 industries. The number of firms in COVID-19 industries in our sample is 512. It is noteworthy
that these firms have less cash, more short-term debt, and more long-term debt than the sample as a whole.
Specifically, median cash over assets for these firms is 5.6%, which is half what it is for the sample as a
whole. Median short-term debt over assets is 2.6%, which is twice what it is for the sample as a whole.
While median long-term debt over assets is 25.9% for the sample as a whole, it is 33.9% for the COVID19 industries. The average payout ratio for COVID-19 firms is 0.042.
We want to investigate whether financial constraints measures commonly used in the literature are
useful to explain how firm stock returns respond to the shock. We use five different measures. Three of
16

these measures use coefficients from regressions that predict whether a firm is financially constrained. The
first of these measures is the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) measure (KZ index). We follow Lamont, Polk,
and Saá-Requejo (2001) in the construction of the index. A higher value of this measure means that a firm
is more constrained. With that index, a firm is more constrained if it has lower cash flow, a higher Tobin’s
q, more leverage, less dividends, and less cash. The second measure is the Whited and Wu (2006) index
(WW index). With that index, a firm is more financially constrained if its cash flow is lower, if it does not
pay dividends, if it has more leverage, if it has less assets, if its industry grows faster, and if it grows more
slowly. Note that cash does not enter the index. The last index we consider is the Size-Age (SA) index of
Hadlock and Pierce (2010) that depends only on firm size and firm age. 8 With that index, older firms and
larger firms are less constrained. For each of these three indices, we define a firm as financially constrained
if it is in the top quartile of the distribution of the relevant index.
Huang and Ritter (2019) construct a measure, cashex ante, which predicts the end-of-year cash position
of a firm if the firm does not access external financing during the year. It is defined as the cash position at
the end of the last fiscal year, plus the net cash flow of last year, used as a projection for the current year’s
net cash flow. 9 Huang and Ritter (2019) show that 27.9% of all firms are projected to have a financing
deficit without raising additional financing that year. We use the projected cash-deficit based on Huang and
Ritter’s (2019) cashex ante measure as a fourth index of whether a firm is financially constrained. In our
sample, 20.1% of all firms and 23.7% of firms in COVID-19 industries are projected to have negative cash
absent external financing. Our final measure of financial constraints is an indicator variable equal to one if
the firm does not have a Standard and Poor’s (S&P) domestic long-term issuer credit rating at the end of
February 2017. The lack of a rating has often been used as a proxy for financial constraints, e.g., by
Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004).

8

We construct two versions of the SA index of Hadlock and Pierce (2010). With their index, they cap firm age at 37
years and firm asset size at $4.5 billion. We create an index using their original thresholds but also create a modified
version of the index where we update the size and age threshold over time to adjust size for inflation and age for the
passage of time.
9
More precisely, net cash flow is defined as the difference between the internal cash flow and the sum of
investment, change in non-cash net working capital, and dividends.

17

Table 1 also shows the stock returns of the firms in our sample for the collapse period from February 2
to March 23. We compute daily excess returns, which we define as the log of one plus the total return on a
stock minus the risk-free rate defined as the one-month daily Treasury bill rate. We cumulate these returns
over the collapse period. It is not surprising that the cumulative returns are negative and large in absolute
value. For the sample as a whole, we have an average cumulative daily log return of -37.8% and a median
cumulative daily log return of -38.7%. As a comparison, the log return to the S&P 500 from February 3 to
March 23 is -37.3% (ln (2237.40/3248.92)). Almost all stocks have a negative cumulative log return, as the
95th percentile of the distribution is -5.5%. However, the range of the cumulative excess returns is broad as
the 5th percentile is -71.2% and the standard deviation of the cumulative excess return is 26.0%. We also
identify the stocks with the best performance during the collapse period. Three stocks have cumulative
returns in excess of 200%. These stocks are IBIO Inc., a biotech company that claimed it was close to a
COVID-19 vaccine, Allied Healthcare Products, a maker of ventilators, and Blue Apron Holdings, Inc., a
food delivery company. Not surprisingly, the firms in the COVID-19 industries perform worse during the
collapse period, as their average cumulative return is -44.0% and the median is -45.8%. Figure 1 plots the
cumulative average return during the collapse period for the whole sample and for the firms in the COVID19 industries. The figure also plots the cumulative return on the average of all stocks listed on the main
exchanges in the US. Although we exclude financials and utilities, the average return of our sample firms
is close to the overall return on the equal-weighted market index.
We turn next to the stock performance of our sample firms on stimulus day, March 24. On that day, the
average sample firm experiences an excess stock return of 9.2%. The median stock return is 8.7%. Most
firms have a positive excess return on that day, as the 5th percentile is only a small negative return of -1.9%.
Turning to the firms in COVID-19 industries, their returns on that day are larger than for the sample as a
whole. The mean excess return is 10.6% and the median excess return is 9.8%.
For a subset of 239 sample firms, we obtain daily mid-price quotes on CDS contracts with a five-year
maturity from CapitalIQ. We focus on the CDS contract with a maturity of five years, because the five-year
CDS is by far the most liquid in the credit derivative market, and the one most used in the literature. Figure
18

2 shows the evolution of CDS spreads for all sample firms and for the 93 COVID-19 industries firms. The
figure shows that CDS spreads quickly started to widen during the collapse period, and more so for COVID19 industries firms. In some of our regressions, we use the cumulative change in CDS spreads between
February 3rd and March 23 as dependent variable. Panel A of Table 1 shows that, for all sample firms, the
average CDS spread increases by 212 basis points, and the median CDS spread increases by 60 basis points.
Panel B demonstrates that for firms in COVID-19 industries, the average CDS spread increases by 301
basis points, and the median spread by 169 basis points. On stimulus day, the average (median) CDS spread
decreases by 15 (5) basis points for the whole sample and by 25 (8) basis points for firms in COVID-19
industries.
In Table 2, we show correlations among the variables we use in our regressions. Panel A reports
correlations estimated using the full sample. The correlations among the variables we use as proxies for
financial flexibility are low. The highest are between long-term debt measures and cash. Firms that have
high levels of long-term debt over assets have lower cash holdings. Not surprisingly, in light of the literature
on cash holdings (e.g., Opler et al., 1999), we find that cash holdings have high correlations with R&D
expenses and SG&A expenses. Short-term debt and long-term debt do not have noticeably high correlations
with any firm characteristic. The correlations between the various financial constraints indices show that
there is little overlap between the firms classified as financially constrained with the KZ index and the ones
classified with the other indices. The correlations are much larger between the WW index and the SA index.
All indices have very low correlations with the HR measure. In Panel B, we report the same correlations
for firms in the COVID-19 industries. The correlations are generally lower. Noticeably large correlations
in absolute value are for long-term debt over assets and COGS and book-to-market (BM), which are both
0.29.

19

4. Financial flexibility and the cross-section of stock returns.
Section 3 shows that there is large cross-sectional variation in cumulative excess stock returns during
the collapse period as well as during stimulus day. In this section, we investigate whether the cross-sectional
variation is supportive of our financial flexibility hypothesis for equity (hypothesis 1 of section 2). Further,
we attempt to measure the value of financial flexibility during the collapse period, defined as the difference
in cumulative excess returns between firms with high financial flexibility and firms with low financial
flexibility.
Our three main variables that together proxy for financial flexibility are cash over assets, short-term
debt over assets, and long-term debt over assets. In Table 3, we estimate regressions of returns on each
variable separately, and then the financial flexibility variables together. We report results for the collapse
period in odd-numbered columns and results for the stimulus day in even-numbered columns. Panel A has
estimates for the whole sample. Columns (1) and (2) show coefficient estimates for cash over assets. We
find that the coefficient on cash is positive and significant for the collapse period, and negative and
significant for the stimulus day. Note that the standard deviation of cumulative returns during the collapse
period is similar to the standard deviation of cash over assets for the whole sample (26.0% versus 26.1%).
As a result, a coefficient of 0.2 in such a regression means that a one standard deviation difference in cash
holdings between two firms predicts a difference in cumulative excess returns slightly larger than 20% of
the standard deviation of returns. Another way to look at the economic significance is that a firm that has
cash over assets greater by one standard deviation of the distribution of cash over assets than another firm
has a higher cumulative excess return during the collapse of 5.14 percentage points. 10 The difference in
returns due to cash holdings is much smaller on stimulus day, because the standard deviation of excess
returns on stimulus day is much smaller. On that day, a one standard deviation difference in cash holdings
corresponds to a 0.70 percentage point difference in returns. Panel B shows results for the COVID-19
industries. The coefficient estimate for the collapse period is similar to the coefficient for the whole sample.

10

Calculated as the coefficient estimate of 0.197 times the standard deviation of cash over assets of 0.261.

20

However, the economic effect is less because the standard deviation of cash holdings for firms in COVID19 industries is much smaller. The coefficient on cash holdings for the stimulus day is not significant.
We now consider the coefficients on debt metrics. In columns (3) and (4) we show estimates for the
coefficient on short-term debt. For the whole sample, the coefficient is negative and significant for the
collapse period but positive and insignificant for the stimulus day. In absolute terms, the coefficient on
short-term debt, -0.257, is higher than the coefficient on cash holdings. However, the standard deviation of
short-term debt is only 5.4%, so that the difference in cumulative excess return for a one standard deviation
difference in short-term debt is small, as it is 1.4 percentage points. With the firms from COVID-19
industries, the coefficient on short-term debt is -0.209, but it is insignificant. Turning to long-term debt in
columns (5) and (6), the coefficient for the whole sample is -0.215 for the collapse period and 0.048 for the
stimulus day. Both coefficients are significant at the 1% level. The coefficients are similar for the COVID19 industries sample. For the collapse period, a one standard deviation difference in long-term debt over
assets corresponds to a 4.9 percentage point difference in cumulative excess return for the entire sample,
and a 5.1 percentage points for the COVID-19 industries sample. We use the net short-term debt measure
in columns (7) and (8). The coefficient on net short-term debt is -0.185 for the whole sample and -0.187 for
the COVID-19 industries sample. The coefficients are significant at least at the 5% level. The economic
significance of a one standard deviation difference in net short-term debt is 5.1 percentage points for the
whole sample, but only 2.4 percentage points for the COVID-19 industries sample because the standard
deviation of net short-term debt is approximately half for the COVID-19 industries sample than for the
whole sample.
In columns (9) and (10), we present estimates of regressions where we include the three variables that
proxy for financial flexibility. For the whole sample, all coefficients fall in absolute value. The coefficients
on cash holdings and long-term debt remain significant for the collapse period, but the coefficient on shortterm debt is not significant. For stimulus day, only the coefficient on long-term debt is significant. Turning
to the COVID-19 industries, only the coefficients for long-term debt are significant.

21

As discussed in the introduction, several commentators have voiced particular concern about the large
share repurchase programs and dividend payments of companies during recent years (see Kahle and Stulz,
2020, for data on payouts and repurchases in the 2000s) and argued that, had companies only given less
money back to shareholders, they would have more financial reserves to face the COVID-19 crisis now. In
columns (11) and (12) of Table 3, we show results when we include the payout ratio in the regressions. The
coefficient on the payout ratio is indistinguishable from zero in the collapse period. The payout ratio is
statistically significant and positive on stimulus day. For the COVID-19 industries, the payout ratio is
insignificant during both the collapse period and on stimulus day. Though we include the payout ratio in
regressions in this section, we postpone a more detailed assessment of the role of payouts in the performance
of firms during the collapse period until the next section.
Overall, Table 3 shows that the excess returns of firms during the collapse period as well as during
stimulus day depend on measures of financial flexibility. However, it seems that long-term debt is a more
important determinant of excess returns both for the whole sample and for the COVID-19 industries sample.
These results are supportive of the financial flexibility hypothesis, but they raise a number of questions that
we address next.
It is clear from Table 1 that there are important cross-sectional differences in characteristics between
firms. It could be that the firms with more cash perform better not because of their cash holdings but
because they are in an industry where firms typically hold more cash. Another related consideration is that
it is well-known that firm capital structures differ across industries. Hence, if a firm has a low level of debt,
it might just mean that it is in an industry where that attribute is valuable. If we use industry fixed effects,
we account for industry effects in cash holdings and leverage, so that a firm that has more cash and less
debt relative to its industry is one that is likely to be more financially flexible. It is also well-known that
stock returns differ because of different exposures of firms to priced risks. For instance, with the capital
asset pricing model, when the market falls, high beta firms will see their stock fall more. These exposures
are related to firm characteristics.

22

In Table 4, we present estimates of the regressions in Table 3 with two additions. First, we add industry
fixed effects, based on the Fama-French 49 industry definitions. Consequently, our estimates of the
coefficients on the financial flexibility variables estimate how returns vary within an industry. Second, we
control for firm characteristics known to be related to stock returns. 11 Specifically, we control for
characteristics that correspond to the risk factors used in several well-known studies. We control for beta,
book-to-market, and firm size (e.g., Fama and French, 1993), momentum (e.g., Carhart, 1997), and
profitability (e.g., Fama and French, 2015; Novy-Marx, 2013). In Panel A of Table 4, the most striking
differences from Table 3 concerning the coefficient estimates for our proxies for financial flexibility is the
sharp decrease in the coefficient on cash over assets in column (1) and the fact that the coefficient is no
longer significant in column (9). Surprisingly, in column (10), all coefficients are positive and significant.
The payout ratio is no longer significant during stimulus day.
When we consider the coefficients on the characteristics, we find that the coefficient on beta is
significantly negative during the collapse period and significantly positive during the stimulus day. Larger
firms perform better during the collapse period and on stimulus day. High book-to-market firms perform
better during the collapse period, and worse on stimulus day. More profitable firms perform better during
the collapse but there is no evidence that they perform differently during stimulus day. It is interesting to
note that in column (1) no coefficient estimate on firm characteristic has an economic significance that
exceeds the economic significance of the coefficient on cash over assets except the one on firm size.
Panel B estimates the same regressions for COVID-19 industries. The results are similar except that
the coefficient on cash stays high in the regression reported in column (1). The economic magnitude of a
one standard deviation increase in cash over assets (0.237 x 0.104 = 2.46%) is now identical to the economic
impact of cash over assets for all firms (0.094 x 0.261 = 2.45%). The other difference is that the coefficient
on short-term debt is positive and significant on stimulus day even in the regression with all the proxies for
flexibility.

11

We adapt the approach of Fahlenbrach, Prilmeier, and Stulz (2012) who examine the determinants of bank stock
returns during the GFC.

23

The regressions in Table 4 provide evidence that firms with more financial flexibility see their stock
price fall less during the collapse period and benefit less from stimulus day. We extend the analysis in Table
5 to allow a firm’s ease to cut costs to affect its stock returns. We expect firms that have more capital
expenditures, more R&D, or more SG&A to find it more difficult to cut spending. From our discussion in
Section 2, these firms should be affected more by the shock. To the extent that cost of goods sold (COGS)
measures variable costs, firms with higher COGS, everything else constant, should have a lower stock-price
drop. Further, we expect firms with an investment grade rating to be more financially flexible than other
firms as these firms are in a good position to raise funds through debt. In contrast, firms with a high-yield
debt rating should be less financially flexible in distressed times and should perform relatively better on
stimulus day. We also include the payout ratio in all regressions.
The regression reported in column (1) of Panel A of Table 5 includes our three proxies for financial
flexibility as well as the additional variables just discussed. We find that each proxy for flexibility has a
significant coefficient with the expected sign for the collapse period. The economic effects remain
meaningful. A one standard deviation lower cash, higher short-term debt and higher long-term debt is
associated with collapse period returns that are 3.5%, 1.3%, and 3.7% lower, respectively. Having an
investment grade rating adds no information. Neither capital expenditures nor R&D expenditures have a
significant coefficient. However, as expected, SG&A has a negative significant coefficient and COGS over
sales has a positive significant coefficient. As before in Table 4, the payout ratio does not have a significant
coefficient. In column (2), we report the same regression but for stimulus day. Of the flexibility variables,
only long-term debt has a significant positive coefficient. Among the other variables (other than the
characteristics from the asset pricing literature), only SG&A has a significant coefficient.
In columns (3) and (4) of Panel A of Table 5, we replace cash over assets and short-term debt over
assets with net short-term debt over assets and add an indicator variable that takes a value of 1 if a firm has
a high-yield rating. The coefficient on net short-term debt is negative and significant as expected. The highyield debt rating indicator variable has a negative statistically significant coefficient. The coefficient is also
economically significant. Companies that have a non-investment grade rating have 5.7 percentage point
24

lower returns during the collapse period. The coefficient on long-term debt in column (3) is weaker than in
the other comparable regressions. Column (4) reports estimates for stimulus day. In column (4), the
coefficient on long-term debt is not significant but the coefficient on the high-yield indicator variable is
positive and significant. The stock price of non-investment grade rated companies increases by an additional
1.6 percentage points on stimulus day. No other changes are noticeable. Finally, columns (5) and (6) use
total book debt over assets instead of short-term debt over assets and long-term debt over assets. The
coefficients on total book debt are significant and of the expected sign. Nothing else changes.
We conduct three robustness tests that we do not report in a table. First, we use the average payout ratio
over three years ending in 2019 instead of the payout ratio in 2019. Our results for the financial flexibility
variable are unchanged and the coefficient on the average payout ratio stays indistinguishable from zero.
Second, instead of calculating the payout ratio as payouts over assets, we calculate it as payouts over net
income minus extraordinary items. With this definition, the payout ratio is not meaningful if the
denominator is negative. We therefore drop observations with negative net income minus extraordinary
items. Using this definition does not change our conclusion about the value of financial flexibility or the
relation between payouts and returns. Third, we also estimate the regressions in columns (1) and (2)
replacing capital expenditure with plant, property, and equipment (PPE) over assets. The coefficient on
PPE is not significant and our conclusions are unchanged.
What can we say about the value of financial flexibility during the COVID-19 crisis? One way to assess
that value is to compare a firm that has low financial flexibility versus one that has high financial flexibility.
Suppose that the low financial flexibility firm is at the 25th percentile of cash holdings, at the 75th percentile
of short-term debt, and at the 75th percentile of long-term debt. Compare that firm to a firm with high
financial flexibility that is at the 75th percentile of cash holdings, at the 25th percentile of short-term debt,
and at the 25th percentile of long-term debt. The difference in cumulative excess returns between these two
firms using the regression in column (1) of Table 5 is 9.7 percentage points during the collapse period when
the mean decrease in the value of common stock across firms is 37 percentage points. Another way to put
this is that a firm with high financial flexibility experienced a drop in its stock price 26% smaller than the
25

average firm. Similar calculations for column (3) (net short-term debt instead of cash and short-term debt)
yield an 8.1 percentage point difference (22% smaller drop than the average). For column (5), where we
have cash and total debt, the calculations yield a 9.5 percentage point difference (26% smaller drop).
In Panel B of Table 5, we show estimates of the same regressions as in Panel A for the sample of firms
in COVID-19 industries. We find that the coefficient on cash holdings is not significant even though its
value is similar to its value in Panel A. However, the coefficient on long-term debt for the collapse period
is significant. When we turn to the regressions using net short-term debt, we find that net short-term debt
has a significant negative coefficient for the collapse period. As in Panel A, the coefficients on the highyield indicator variable are significant and economically large. Firms in COVID-19 industries that have a
high-yield rating exhibit 10.9% lower returns during the collapse period. The coefficients on SG&A are not
significant, but the coefficients on COGS for the collapse period are significant and more than three times
larger than in Panel A.
It is well-known that theoretically a firm’s equity beta increases with leverage. A concern with our
results is that long-term debt over assets is related to returns not because firms with more long-term debt
have less financial flexibility but because such firms have a higher beta. In Table 6, we modify the
regressions of Table 5 by splitting beta into two parts: unlevered beta and the beta due to leverage. The
definitions of the two betas are given in Appendix A. When we do that, we allow the coefficient on the two
components of beta to differ. An important caveat with this decomposition is that, as shown in Table 2, the
beta due to leverage is highly correlated with long-term debt to assets. We find that the coefficient on
unlevered beta is quite small compared to the coefficient on the beta due to leverage. This decomposition
does not change our conclusions concerning the role of cash and long-term debt as proxies for financial
flexibility, but short-term debt ceases to be significant. Another way to put this is that if one attempts to
capture the impact of leverage on beta more precisely, the coefficients on cash and long-term debt remain
significant. However, the coefficients on the proxies understate the whole impact of financial flexibility as
a lack of financial flexibility means that the firm’s equity co-moves more with the market, so that the value
of equity is more affected by an economic downturn. COGS and SG&A continue to have significant
26

coefficients in the predicted direction. In column (5), where we restrict the sample to the COVID-19
industries, the coefficient on long-term debt remains economically meaningful during the collapse period,
but loses statistical significance.
5. The value of financial flexibility, payouts, and corporate diversification
In Section 4, we find no evidence of a relation between stock returns during the collapse period and
corporate payouts in 2019 even when we do not control for our financial flexibility proxies. Since greater
corporate payouts, everything else equal, reduce financial flexibility, such a result is puzzling. We
investigate this result further and attempt to better understand the relation between payouts and stock return
performance in the first part of this section. A diversified corporation can use its internal capital market to
substitute in part for external finance. Hence, we would expect corporate diversification to be an advantage
in the present of a shock like the COVID-19 shock. We investigate whether this is the case in the second
part of this section.

5.a. Payouts and financial flexibility.
The regressions presented in Section 4 estimate the relation between stock returns and payouts and
show insignificant coefficients on the payout ratio even when we do not control for firm characteristics.
Such a result could make sense if the impact of payouts on financial flexibility is small on average. We
present evidence in this section that supports this explanation, but also show that the payouts of firms with
high cumulative payouts for the three years ending in 2019 over assets did have a substantial impact on
their financial flexibility and hence their stock returns during the collapse.
In Table 7, we present statistics for our financial flexibility measures and payout ratios for the entire
sample and for subsamples based on payout ratio quartiles to assess the extent to which payouts affect our
financial flexibility proxies. We implement a pro forma approach of the type introduced by DeAngelo,
DeAngelo, and Stulz (2006) where we estimate what the cash over assets ratio or the long-term debt over
assets ratio would have been at the end of 2019 had the firm had no payouts. We do not take into account
the second-order effect that the firm would have to pay less interest on debt since it would have less debt.
27

Columns (1) to (3) show these statistics if we use the 2019 payouts over assets ratio as the main sorting
variable. With this approach, we see that average cash over assets ratio would have only increased from
0.224 to 0.251 had the firm not paid out in 2019. The reductions in long-term debt would have been similarly
small; the average long-term debt ratio would have only decreased from 0.279 to 0.244. Using the
coefficients of Table 5, Panel A, column (1), the stock return would have been higher by 0.36 percentage
points (0.134 x (0.251 – 0.224)) had the firm retained payouts to increase cash or by 0.57 percentage points
had the firm retained payouts to reduce long-term debt (0.163 x (0.279 – 0.244)).
The next five rows show results for the firms that were in the top quartile for the payout ratio in 2019.
For them, the average payout over assets ratio increases to 0.111. But even for those high payout firms, the
average cash over assets ratio would have only increased from 0.15 to 0.233, and the average long-termdebt ratio would have only decreased from 0.316 to 0.204. The corresponding increases in returns are 1.11
and 1.83 percentage points.
These numbers suggest that total payouts in 2019 were not large relative to the cash balances and debt
of companies, not even for top quartile payers. However, sample firms not only paid out significant amounts
in 2019, but also in earlier years. Columns (4) to (6) repeat the analysis but now use the cumulative payouts
from 2017 to 2019 over assets in 2019 as the sorting variable. 12
Column (6) shows that the importance of payouts increases. Cumulative payouts are on average 11.4%
of assets. The average cash balance would have increased from 0.199 to 0.272, while the average long-term
debt would have decreased from 0.288 to 0.174. As a result, the stock return would have been higher by
0.98 percentage points or 1.86 percentage points had the payouts been used to increase cash reserves or
reduce debt, respectively.
The mean payout rate for firms in the top quartile of the cumulative payout ratio distribution is much
higher as it is almost six times larger than the mean payout rate for firms in the middle quartiles (33.7%
versus 5.9%). Consequently, if firms in the middle quartiles had not had payouts for the three years ending

12

The number of observations decreases as not all firms have a three-year history in Compustat.

28

in 2019, the impact on their financial flexibility proxies would be limited. Looking at long-term debt, the
long-term debt over assets for the average firm in the middle quartiles would fall from 0.285 to 0.226. In
contrast, for the firms in the top quartile of payout rates, long-term debt over assets would fall from 0.313
to -0.019, so that on average firms could have paid back their long-term debt and would have had cash left
over had they had no payouts for the last three years. Using the coefficient on long-term debt of -0.163 from
the regression in column (1) of Table 5 to assess the economic impact, firms in the middle quartiles would
have had higher returns by 0.96 percentage points had they not had payouts and instead paid down long
term-debt while firms in the top quartile would have had higher returns by 5.1 percentage points (0.163 x
(0.313 – 0)).
Given the large difference in payout rates between firms with average payout rates and firms in the top
quartile of cumulative payout rates, we now consider regressions that allow a nonlinear relation between
payout rates and stock returns. We define an indicator variable that takes the value one if a firm is in the
top quartile of the payout rate defined as cumulative three-year payouts from 2017 to 2019 divided by assets
in 2019. We show the estimates in Table 8 and find that the indicator variable is never significant, neither
for the entire sample nor for the COVID-19 industries sample. Adding the indicator variable has little
impact on the coefficients for cash over assets, short-term debt over assets, and long-term debt over assets.
It is useful to understand which companies tend to have high payout rates when payouts are computed
as a percentage of assets. For that purpose, we looked at the 50 firms that have the highest payout rate in
2019. Most firms in that list have assets of less than $10 billion. The largest firm in that list is Apple. Apple
has $339 billion in assets; the next largest firm is Cisco with $98 billion in assets, and the third largest firm
is Biogen that has $27 billion in assets. Apple and Cisco have more cash than long-term debt. Biogen Inc.
has slightly less cash than long-term debt. But the list also has firms with almost no cash and much longterm debt. An example is Denny’s Corp that paid out 21.2% of assets, had cash over assets of 1.5%, and
had long-term debt equal to 88.5% of assets. The list suggests that the firms with high payout ratios are two
different groups of firms: some firms have a very strong balance sheet and are very profitable, and they can
have high payouts without weakening their balance sheet. Other firms are extremely highly levered and
29

may have acquired this leverage to finance their payouts. In our regressions, we do not distinguish between
types of payers. Further work exploring whether the payout coefficients depend on firm characteristics
would be helpful in understanding the relation between payouts and stock returns during the collapse phase
better.
In 2019, 18 firms paid out more than $10 billion each. Of these firms, none is financially inflexible.
One firm is highly financially flexible, namely Alphabet, which has almost no long-term debt and has a
ratio of cash over assets of 43.4%. Some firms like Apple and Microsoft have both large amounts of cash
and large amounts of debt. These firms would be highly financially flexible if we focused on the distribution
of net debt. Four of the top five firms that have the highest dollar payouts in 2019 have more cash than
long-term debt. However, only three firms in the next forty-five firms when we rank firms by dollar payouts
have more cash than long-term debt.
A concern with our approach is that we control for industry. Our approach effectively measures whether
stock returns differ because of payout rates within industries. It turns out that the results would not be much
different if we did not control for industries. Though we do not tabulate the results, we re-estimate Table 8
without industry fixed effects. The payout coefficients remain insignificant. This result may be due to the
fact that many firms in computer-related industries have high payout rates, so that these firms are more
likely to be in the top quartile, but firms in that industry generally performed better during the collapse.

5.b. Conglomerates and stock returns during the collapse period and on stimulus day.
There is a considerable literature in finance that investigates the costs and benefits of corporate
diversification (see Maksimovic and Phillips, 2013, for a review of the literature). Though there are
recognized costs to the conglomerate form of organization, one obvious benefit is that it may make it
possible to fund projects that the financial markets may not fund if they are under stress. Hence,
conglomerates may be in a better position to fund valuable activities during periods of financial stress than
specialized firms that undertake the same type of activities. Empirical evidence by Matvos and Seru (2014)
and Kuppuswamy and Villalonga (2016) supports the view that conglomerates had some advantages in
30

coping with the stressed financial markets of the GFC. With the COVID-19 crisis, it is unclear how much
the conglomerate form is useful. Suppose that all activities of a conglomerate face a sudden stop. In this
case, the situation of a conglomerate might be similar to the situation of a specialized firm except that the
conglomerate can sell subsidiaries outside of its core activities if there is a functioning market for these
subsidiaries. In this section, we investigate whether conglomerates performed better for a given level of
proxies of financial flexibility. The maintained hypothesis is that a conglomerate has more financial
flexibility than a specialized firm for a given level of the financial flexibility proxies because it has an
internal capital market.
We investigate whether diversified firms performed differently by constructing a sample of firms for
which we can identify whether the firm is diversified or specialized. We follow the approach of
Kuppuswamy and Villalonga (2016). We use the Compustat Segments database. For each firm in that
database that is also in our main sample, we identify each of the Fama-French 49 (FF49) industries in which
it is active. A firm that is active in only one FF49 industry is designated as a specialized firm. The other
firms are diversified firms or conglomerates. We assume that firms that are not in the Compustat Segments
database are specialized firms. With our definition, 375 (20.2%) sample firms are diversified firms. In Table
9, columns (1) and (2), we re-estimate the regressions of Table 5, columns (1) and (2), and include an
indicator variable that takes the value of one if a firm is diversified. We drop the industry fixed effects to
make sure that these fixed effects do not prevent us from assessing correctly the effect of corporate
diversification since the conglomerate firms are in multiple industries. However, the results are similar if
we use industry fixed effects and assign each conglomerate to the industry of its largest segment. We find
that the conglomerate indicator variable is not significant. In columns (3) and (4), we interact the indicator
variable with the proxies for financial flexibility. The only change in column (3) is that the interaction of
cash with the indicator variable is positive and significant, suggesting that cash is more valuable for a
conglomerate. This would be consistent with a conglomerate being able to direct cash to segments that can
make the most use of it given the stress in financial markets. However, conglomerates are also often
acquisitive, so that we cannot exclude that an alternative explanation is that there are distressed acquisition
31

prospects that a conglomerate with cash might be able to acquire. In column (4), the only change is that the
interaction of the indicator variable with short-term debt is positive. In columns (5) through (8) of Table 9,
we show results for conglomerates whose main segment is in a COVID-19 industry. The estimates of the
indicator variable and its interactions for the collapse period are never significant. For the stimulus day, we
find that conglomerates with more long-term debt gain less on that day.
It follows from the evidence presented in Table 9 that there is little evidence that the conglomerate form
was especially valuable during the collapse period in the COVID-19 crisis.

6. Financial constraints and the cross-section of stock returns.
In this section, we investigate whether the various indices of financial constraints help explain the crosssection of excess returns during the collapse period as well as during stimulus day. We show results for the
Kaplan and Zingales (1997) index (KZ index), the Whited and Wu (2006) index (WW index), and the SA
index of Hadlock and Pierce (2010). We also include as a measure of financial constraints whether a firm
does not have a bond rating (e.g., Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach, 2004). Lastly, we use Huang and
Ritter’s (2019) cash deficit measure.
We estimate the regressions of Table 4, but instead of having variables that proxy for financial
flexibility, we include indicator variables for firms with a financial constraint index in the top quartile of
the distribution of the index (KZ, WW, SA indices), for firms without a rating, or for firms with a projected
cash deficit. In other words, the table answers the question of whether the most financially constrained
firms perform worse during the collapse period and better on stimulus day than other firms. For the
traditional three financial constraints indices, Table 10 shows that there is no evidence that the most
constrained firms exhibit worse returns when we control for firm characteristics and industry fixed effects,
neither when we use the entire sample (Panel A) nor when we restrict the sample to COVID-19 industries
(Panel B). Surprisingly, the firms that are highly constrained according to the Whited-Wu index actually
performed better during the collapse period. We conjectured when developing hypothesis 2 that we may
not find evidence for a negative effect of financial constraints on stock prices during the collapse period
32

because these firms could have large precautionary cash holdings. Specifically, a firm might be unable to
access capital markets, but if its precautionary cash holdings are large enough, it can fund itself for the
period of the sudden revenue stop. In contrast to the traditional measures of financial constraints, the HuangRitter measure is explicitly focused on the ability of firms to fund themselves out of their existing cash
holdings. We find that it is significant and has the expected sign, namely firms that would run out of cash
absent outside finance are firms that perform worse during the collapse period. The effect is economically
large. Firms with a projected cash deficit have returns lower by 3.5 percentage points during the collapse
period. In panel B (COVID-19 industries), the coefficient for the Huang-Ritter measure is of similar
magnitude (3.1 percentage points), but loses statistical significance. The indicator variable for firms without
a credit rating is positive. This is surprising in that if these firms are more financially constrained, we would
expect them to perform worse. However, more firms have a non-investment grade rating than have an
investment grade rating in the sample. As a result, the indicator variable no debt rating corresponds to an
indicator variable for “not a highly levered firm”.

7. Financial flexibility and the cross-section of CDS spread changes.
In this section, we investigate whether firms with greater financial flexibility experience a smaller
increase in credit spreads than other firms in response to the COVID-19 shock. We would expect firms with
greater financial flexibility to be less likely to default during the period of the sudden stop as they have
greater ability to fund their cash flow shortfall. On stimulus day in turn, we would expect that the default
probability of those firms drops less as a result of the news on policy responses. For our analysis, we
estimate the regressions of Table 4, columns (9) and (10) as well as Table 5, columns (1) and (2), but instead
of using cumulative excess stock returns as the dependent variable, we use the change in the CDS premium.
CDS premiums provide a proxy for a firm’s creditworthiness that is often used in the literature (e.g., Duffie,
1999). Unfortunately, CDS premiums are available only for 239 sample firms and 93 firms in COVID-19
industries.

33

We show the regression estimates in Table 11. Columns (1) through (4) of Table 11 report the results
for the whole sample. We divide the CDS premium by one hundred for better readability of the table. The
coefficients on cash over assets are not statistically significant. However, the coefficients on both shortterm debt and long-term debt are significantly positive for the collapse period and significantly negative on
stimulus day. The economic magnitude can be gauged as follows. In column (3), the coefficient on longterm debt (short-term debt) is 5.99 (7.945). For firms with available CDS data, the standard deviation of
long-term debt (short-term debt) over assets is 0.178 (0.043). A one-standard deviation higher ratio of longterm debt over assets therefore increases the CDS premium by 5.99 x 0.178 x 100 = 107 basis points more.
Such a change is large given that the mean change in CDS premiums is 211.9 basis points and the median
change is only 59.8 basis points. The economic magnitude of a one standard deviation increase in shortterm debt is 34 basis points.
We carry out a similar calculation for the value of financial flexibility during the COVID-19 crisis as
for the stock return regressions. We compare a firm that has low financial flexibility, i.e., one that is at the
25th percentile of cash holdings, at the 75th percentile of short-term debt, and at the 75th percentile of longterm debt with a firm with high financial flexibility that is at the 75th percentile of cash holdings, at the 25th
percentile of short-term debt, and at the 25th percentile of long-term debt. We calculate the interquartile
range for the financial flexibility measures for only those firms that have CDS traded. 13 A firm with low
financial flexibility experiences an increase in the CDS premium that is 176 basis points higher than the
increase for a highly financially flexible firm.
The coefficient on the indicator variable for investment grade debt is negative and significant for the
collapse period. The coefficient on the investment grade indicator variable is equal to -1.40, which means
that firms with an investment grade rating have an increase in CDS premiums that is on average 140 basis
points lower than for non-investment grade firms during the collapse period. We find that the change in the
CDS premiums is affected by firm variables that proxy for fixed costs. We find positive coefficients on

13

The interquartile ranges are 0.083 for cash over assets, 0.040 for short-term debt over assets, and 0.223 for longterm debt over assets.

34

Capex and SG&A for the collapse period and a significantly negative coefficient on Capex on stimulus day.
Surprisingly, the coefficient on COGS is positive and significant as well. In columns (5) through (8), we
report the coefficient estimates for the COVID-19 industries. The results are fairly similar to the results for
the entire sample except that the coefficients on short-term debt are not significant although they are of
similar magnitude as for the entire sample. The same holds true for the coefficient on long-term debt on
stimulus day. The payout ratio has no effect on CDS premiums, neither during the collapse period nor
during stimulus day.
Overall, the results of Table 11 mirror those of the stock return regressions for the collapse period.
Firms with more financial flexibility fare relatively better. This result is consistent with hypothesis 3 of
section 2.

8. Conclusion.
In this paper, we examine the value of financial flexibility in the unique situation of a sudden and
unexpected revenue shortfall. We find that, everything else equal, the revenue shortfall affects a firm’s
stock and its CDS premiums less if the firm is more financially flexible. Firms with less flexible costs are
affected more. These results are strongest for a firm’s ratio of long-term debt to assets. We also investigate
how firms’ stock prices and CDS premiums react to news of macroeconomic measures designed to attenuate
the shock. We expect that firms with more financial flexibility benefit less from these measures. We find
that this is the case, but again more so for long-term debt over assets than for cash holdings. Though one
would expect that payouts reduce financial flexibility, we find that once we control for firm characteristics
and proxies for financial flexibility, there is no evidence that firms with higher payouts are affected more
adversely by the COVID-19 crisis in our regressions. However, at the same time, using our estimates of the
relation between stock returns and financial flexibility, we find that firms with payout rates above the 75th
percentile would, on average, have been able to pay off their long-term debt had they not had payouts over
the last three years and their stock returns would have been by 5.1 percentage points higher.

35

What can we say about the value of financial flexibility during the COVID-19 crisis? One way to assess
that value is to compare the cumulative excess stock return of a firm that has low financial flexibility versus
the cumulative excess return of a firm that has high financial flexibility, keeping everything else the same.
Suppose that the low financial flexibility is at the 25th percentile of cash holdings, at the 75th percentile of
short-term debt, and at the 75th percentile of long-term debt. Compare that firm to a firm with high financial
flexibility that is at the 75th percentile of cash holdings, at the 25th percentile of short-term debt, and at the
25th percentile of long-term debt. The difference in cumulative excess returns between these two firms is
9.7 percentage points during the collapse period when the mean decrease in the value of common stock
across firms is 37 percentage points. Another way to put this is that the difference between the stock price
drop of a firm with high financial flexibility and the stock price drop of a firm with low financial flexibility
is equal to 26% of the stock price drop of the average firm. Our comparable estimate for CDS spreads is
that a firm with low financial flexibility experiences an increase in the CDS spread that is 176 basis point
higher than a firm with high financial flexibility during the collapse period when on average CDS spreads
increase by 212 basis points.
Though financial economists have argued that financial flexibility might be used to hurt shareholders
(Jensen, 1986), investor activists have campaigned to force firms to decrease cash holdings and increase
leverage, and the private equity industry has made the reduction of financial flexibility intrinsic to its
business model, these results should remind us that financial flexibility is also a key risk management tool.
However, this tool does not come for free. Future research should help us understand better how to value
the downside of financial flexibility to help shareholders and managers to trade off the benefits and costs
of financial flexibility more effectively.

which equals the last observation of daily close price (PRCCD) at year end 2019
multiplied with the number of shares outstanding (CSHOC).
The natural logarithm of the firm’s last observation of daily close price (PRCCD) at
year end 2019 multiplied with its number of shares outstanding (CSHOC).

2
× CHE2019 − CHE2018 − (DLTIS2019 − DLTR2019 + DLCCH2019) –
HR cash ex-ante
(SSTK2019 – PRSTKC2019). We set missing SSTK, PRSTKC, DLTIS, and DLTR
to zero. We set missing DLCCH2019 to DLC2019 – DLC2018.
An indicator variable set to one if the firm’s HR-cash ex-ante variable is in the top
FC (HR cash ex-ante)
quartile of the distribution and set to zero otherwise.

Table 3: Stock returns and financial flexibility measures
The table shows results from cross-sectional regressions of stock returns in excess of the risk-free interest rate on firm characteristics. All odd-numbered columns
(Collapse period) show results for cumulative stock returns for sample firms from February 3, 2020 to March 23, 2020, and all even-numbered columns (Stimulus day)
show results for the return from March 23 to March 24, 2020. Variable definitions are provided in Appendix B. Panel A shows results for all non-financial and nonutility firms with available fiscal-year 2019 data in Compustat. Panel B shows results for industries that are particularly affected by the measures designed to fight the
COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 industries are defined as Fama–French 49 industries Entertainment, Construction, Automobiles and trucks, Aircraft, Ships, Personal
services, Business services, Transportation, Wholesale, Retail, and Restaurants, hotels and motels. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics, and ∗∗∗, ∗∗, and ∗ indicate
statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 4: Stock returns, financial flexibility measures, and stock characteristics
The table shows results from cross-sectional regressions of stock returns in excess of the risk-free interest rate on firm characteristics. All odd-numbered columns
(Collapse period) show results for cumulative stock returns for sample firms from February 3, 2020 to March 23, 2020, and all even-numbered columns (Stimulus
day) show results for the return from March 23 to March 24, 2020. Variable definitions are provided in Appendix B. Characteristics from the asset pricing literature
include the firm’s equity beta, the stock return in calendar year 2019, the book-to-market ratio, the natural log of the market value of the firm’s equity, and gross
profitability scaled by assets. Panel A shows results for all non-financial and non-utility firms with available fiscal-year 2019 data in Compustat. Panel B shows results
for industries that are particularly affected by the measures designed to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 industries are defined as Fama-French 49 industries
Entertainment, Construction, Automobiles and trucks, Aircraft, Ships, Personal services, Business services, Transportation, Wholesale, Retail, and Restaurants, hotels
and motels. All regressions include industry-fixed effects. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics, and ∗∗∗, ∗∗, and ∗ indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% level, respectively.

Table 7: Payout ratios by quartile and financial flexibility measures
The table presents summary statistics for financial flexibility and payout ratios for the entire sample, as well as for sample
splits by payout ratio quartiles. Columns (1) to (3) present numbers if we use the 2019 payout / assets ratio to split the sample
into quartiles, and columns (4) to (6) present the numbers if we use the cumulative payouts from 2017 to 2019 divided by
2019 assets to split the sample into quartiles and to calculate the ratios. Columns (1) and (4) show the number of observations
with complete data, columns (2) and (5) show medians, and columns (3) and (6) show means. The variable (cash + payout) /
(assets + payout) shows what the cash over assets ratio of a company would have been if the company had retained all 2019
payouts (columns (2) and (3)) or all cumulative payouts between 2017 and 2019 (columns (5) and (6)). The variable (Lt-debt
– payout) / assets shows what the long-term debt / assets ratio of a company would have been had the firm used all 2019
payouts (columns (2) and (3)) or all cumulative payouts between 2017 and 2019 (columns (5) and (6)) to pay down its longterm debt. The sample consists of all non-financial and non-utility firms with available fiscal-year 2019 data in Compustat.
Appendix A shows the sample selection procedure. All variables are defined in Appendix B.

Table 8: Stock returns, financial flexibility measures, and a top quartile payout ratio indicator variable
The table shows results from cross-sectional regressions of stock returns in excess of the risk-free interest rate on firm
characteristics, and an indicator variable equal to one if the cumulative payouts over 2017 to 2019 over 2019 assets were in
the top quartile of the distribution, and zero otherwise. All odd-numbered columns (Collapse period) show results for
cumulative stock returns for sample firms from February 3, 2020 to March 23, 2020, and all even-numbered columns
(Stimulus day) show results for the return from March 23 to March 24, 2020. Variable definitions are provided in Appendix
B. Columns (1) through (4) show results for all non-financial and non-utility firms with available fiscal-year 2019 data in
Compustat. Columns (5) through (8) show results for industries that are particularly affected by the measures designed to
fight the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 industries are defined as Fama–French 49 industries Entertainment, Construction,
Automobiles and trucks, Aircraft, Ships, Personal services, Business services, Transportation, Wholesale, Retail, and
Restaurants, hotels and motels. All regressions include industry-fixed effects. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics, and
∗∗∗, ∗∗, and ∗ indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 10: Stock returns and measures of financial constraints
The table shows results from cross-sectional regressions of stock returns in excess of the risk-free interest rate on measures of financial constraints. All odd-numbered
columns (Collapse period) show results for cumulative stock returns for sample firms from February 3, 2020 to March 23, 2020 and all even-numbered columns
(Stimulus day) show results for the return from March 23 to March 24, 2020. Variable definitions are provided in Appendix B. Characteristics from the asset pricing
literature include the firm’s equity beta, the stock return in calendar year 2019, the book-to-market ratio, the natural log of the market value of the firm’s equity, and
gross profitability scaled by assets. Panel A shows results for all non-financial and non-utility firms with available fiscal-year 2019 data in Compustat. Panel B shows
results for industries that are particularly affected by the measures designed to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 industries are defined as Fama-French 49
industries Entertainment, Construction, Automobiles and trucks, Aircraft, Ships, Personal services, Business services, Transportation, Wholesale, Retail, and
Restaurants, hotels and motels. All regressions include industry-fixed effects. Numbers in parentheses are t-statistics, and ∗∗∗, ∗∗, and ∗ indicate statistical significance
at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
