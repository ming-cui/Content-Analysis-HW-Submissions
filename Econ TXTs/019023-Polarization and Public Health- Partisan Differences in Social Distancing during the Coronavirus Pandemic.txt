Abstract
We study partisan differences in Americans’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Political
leaders and media outlets on the right and left have sent divergent messages about the severity
of the crisis, and this could potentially undermine public compliance with key measures such
as social distancing. We develop a simple model of a pandemic response with heterogeneous
agents that clarifies the causes and consequences of divergent responses. We use location
data from a large sample of smartphones to show that areas with more Republicans engage in
less social distancing, controlling for other factors including state policies, population density,
and local COVID cases and deaths. We then present new survey evidence of significant gaps
between Republicans and Democrats in beliefs about personal risk and the future path of the
pandemic.

Introduction

Mobilizing an effective public response to an emerging pandemic requires clear communication
and trust (Holmes 2008; Taylor et al. 2009; van der Weerd et al. 2011; Vaughn and Tinker
2011). Key measures such as social distancing and self-quarantine can rarely be enforced entirely
by coercion, particularly in democratic societies. The public must understand what is required of
them and be persuaded of the importance of complying.
In this sense, partisan differences could be a key risk factor in the US response to the COVID19 pandemic. Prominent officials have sent conflicting messages about the crisis, with President
Trump and other Republican officials sometimes saying it was less severe, and Democrats giving
more emphasis to its dangers (Beauchamp 2020; Stanley-Becker and Janes 2020; Coppins 2020;
McCarthy 2020). Partisan media have tended to echo this division (Aleem 2020; Kantrowitz 2020).
The result could be gaps between citizens on the right and left in their compliance with public
health measures such as social distancing, possibly leading to large human and economic costs.
In this paper, we combine GPS location data from a large sample of smartphones with a new
survey to study partisan differences in the early response to COVID-19. The GPS data are collected by the company SafeGraph, and record daily and weekly visits to points of interest (POIs),
including restaurants, hotels, hospitals, and many other public and private businesses. Our primary
analysis focuses on the period from January 26, 2020 to March 28, 2020.
We begin with two motivating facts. First, recent nationwide surveys have shown that Democrats
are more concerned about the spread of COVID-19 and report taking more steps to avoid infection than Republicans. Second, counties with higher Democratic vote shares in the 2016 election
saw more social distancing, as measured by location data. However, these counties also had more
coronavirus cases and were in states that initiated stay-at-home policies earlier. Thus, the partisan
differences in social distancing could simply be the expected result of local differences in infection
risk or regulation.
We present a simple model that clarifies the potential causes and consequences of divergent
social-distancing behavior. It combines a standard epidemiological model of a pandemic with
an economic model of optimizing behavior by heterogeneous agents. The model clarifies that
divergent responses between groups need not be inefficient. One group might engage in less social
distancing because their costs of distancing are greater (e.g., they would lose more income as a
result) or because their benefits of distancing are smaller (e.g., they are at lower risk of infection).

2

However, differences in behavior resulting from divergent beliefs of otherwise similar agents do
suggest systematic inefficiency, as optimizing based on different beliefs means that the marginal
costs of social distancing are not equated across people. In that case, society gets less social
distancing at higher cost than if agents had the same beliefs.
Our main GPS results show that the strong partisan differences in social distancing behavior
that emerged with the rise of COVID-19 are not merely an artifact of differences in state policies or observed risks. Controlling for state-time fixed effects to account for heterogenous policy
responses by state governments only attenuates the partisan gap slightly. Including controls to
proxy for health and economic variables interacted flexibly with time attenuates the gap more substantially, but it remains statistically and economically significant. After including our full set of
controls, we estimate that moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of Republican county vote
share is associated with a 16.7 percent increase in the number of POI visits during the week of
March 22.
Our findings are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of control variables, excluding states with
early COVID-19 outbreaks, or dropping highly populated counties. Replacing the continuous measure of partisanship with discrete indicators for portions of the Republican vote share distribution
or restricting the sample to counties from certain portions of the distribution does not change our
qualitative conclusions. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a similar partisan gap during the same
period in 2019.
Finally, we use new survey data to provide additional evidence on the differences in beliefs
that may underlie the partisan gap in behavior. This survey was conducted from April 4-6, 2020.
We collect participants’ demographics (including party affiliation), beliefs regarding the efficacy of
social distancing, self-reported distancing due to COVID-19, and predictions about future COVID19 cases. We confirm that Democrats believe the pandemic to be more severe and report adjusting
their behavior more than Republicans do on average. In our survey, we also randomly vary whether
predictions are incentivized, and do not find evidence that incentives reduce the partisan gap, suggesting that these predictions are less likely to be due to partisan cheerleading (as in Bullock et al.
2015 and Prior et al. 2015), and more likely to reflect true differences in beliefs.
Several contemporaneous studies also measure partisan differences in responses to COVID19.1 Gadarian et al. (2020) present survey evidence showing partisan gaps in self-reported re1 Coverage

in the media and some studies examine partisan heterogeneity in response to COVID-19 with no or few
controls for differential risk exposure or costs of social distancing (e.g., Economist 2020; Andersen 2020). Baker et
al. (2020) use transaction-level data and examine heterogeneity in consumption responses to COVID-19.

sponses to the pandemic. Barrios and Hochberg (2020) show differences between Republican and
Democratic areas in the frequency of COVID-related queries on Google and in movement patterns
as measured in GPS data from a different source than the one we use here. Painter and Qiu (2020)
examine partisan heterogeneity in response to state-level, stay-at-home orders.
Our work contributes to a broader literature on what drives responses to pandemics (e.g.,
Blendon et al. 2008; Vaughan and Tinker 2009; Fineberg 2014). Risk perception, behavior
changes, and trust in government information sources change as pandemics progress (Ibuka et
al. 2010; Bults et al. 2011). Demographic characteristics, such as gender, income, geography,
or social interactions, are important determinants of the adoption of recommended public health
behaviors (Bish and Michie 2010; Ibuka et al. 2010; Bults et al. 2011; Chuang et al. 2015; Shultz
et al. 2016; Gamma et al. 2017).
A related literature focuses on the consequences of political polarization for health behaviors
(e.g., Iyengar et al. 2019 and Montoya-Williams and Fuentes-Afflick 2019). Party affiliation is
correlated with physician recommendations on politicized health procedures, enrollment in government exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, and beliefs in the safety of vaccines
(Hersh and Goldenberg 2016; Lerman et al. 2017; Sances and Clinton 2019; Trachtman 2019;
Krupenkin 2018; Suryadevara et al. 2019). We show how partisan differences can lead to the
inefficient allocation of public health goods, such as social distancing, during pandemics.
Our work also relates to a broader literature on partisan differences in trust and beliefs. For
instance, a large body of empirical literature documents partisan differences in beliefs about factual
events such as unemployment (Bartels 2002; Gaines et al. 2007; Bullock et al. 2015). There exists
a growing literature on building theoretical models of opinion polarization to explain observed
partisanship (Dixit and Weibull 2007; Benoit and Dubra 2015; Ortoleva and Snowber 2015; Fryer
et al. 2019). Furthermore, a substantial empirical literature studies the link between media markets
and political polarization (Glaeser and Ward 2006; McCarty et al. 2006; Campante and Hojman
2013; Prior 2013).
Finally, our work adds to the increasing number of papers using GPS or related data to study
social interactions. For example, Dubé et al. (2017) test the effectiveness of mobile targeting with
coupons to competing movie theaters based on consumers’ real-time location. Hanna et al. (2017)
use data from Google Maps to estimate the effects of lifting high-occupancy vehicle restrictions
in Jakarta, Indonesia.2 Chen and Rohla (2018) and Athey et al. (2019) use SafeGraph data to

Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, present our motivating facts, theoretical framework,
data, GPS analysis, and survey results.

Motivating Facts

In this section, we present basic facts on differences in beliefs and social distancing by political
party. Figure 1 presents results from previous national polls. Panel A shows that Democrats
were consistently more concerned than Republicans about the spread of coronavirus in the United
States from January 26 through the most recent polls in early April. The next three panels show
differences in self-reported social distancing behaviors. Panel B presents results from a March 13th
poll, showing that Democrats were more likely to say they were eating at home more often, had
stocked up on food and supplies, changed travel plans, and cancelled plans to avoid crowds. Panels
C and D show that throughout the month of March, Democrats were more likely than Republicans
to say that they were avoiding public places and small gatherings.
Of course, one would like to know whether these self-reported behavior changes can be corroborated in observational data. Figure 2 visualizes geographic variation in this social distancing
response, and compares observed variation to analogous distributions of partisanship, COVID-19
confirmed cases, and public policy responses. Panel A maps the social distancing response observed in each county, as measured by the percent decrease in SafeGraph visits between the week
beginning January 26th and the week beginning March 22nd, using data described below. Panel
B shades counties by their party affiliation, captured by the Republican vote share in the 2016
presidential election. Panel C maps the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in a given county
by March 28th. Panel D shades states by the effective start date for the earliest statewide “stay-athome” order issued. Panels A and B exhibit a strong geographic correlation between the counties
with weaker social distancing responses and those with higher Republican vote shares. Panel
D shows that areas with stronger distancing responses also generally instituted earlier statewide,
stay-at-home orders. We also observe stronger social distancing responses in counties with more
COVID-19 confirmed cases (Panel C).
These results highlight the value of a framework to understand why people from the two political parties behave differently, and why that might matter.

Stylized Model

In this section, we present a stylized model to clarify why it might matter if different types of
people choose different amounts of social distancing. We embed an epidemiological model of
disease transmission into an economic model with agents who maximize utility considering the
expected private cost of disease.
3.1

Epidemiological Model

We use a discrete time version of the standard SIR epidemiological model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927). In each period t, each person is in one of four states σ ∈ {S, I, R, D}, representing
Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased. The share of the population in each state at time t
is st , it , rt , and dt . Let β represent disease infectiousness, and let ct denote an individual’s amount
of risky behavior at time t—for example, the amount of travel, dining out, failing to wash hands,
and other activities that increase risk of becoming Infected.
All people begin in the Susceptible state. A Susceptible person becomes Infected at time t + 1
with probability ct β it and stays Susceptible with probability (1 − ct β it ). Infected people stay
Infected for one period, after which they become Deceased with probability ψ or Recovered with
probability (1 − ψ). Both D and R are absorbing states.
Let θ index different types of people—for example, liberals and conservatives. Let ωθ σt be
a state variable representing the share of type θ that is in state σ at time t. The population is of
measure 1, so ∑θ ∑σ ωθ σt = 1.
3.2

Individual Decisions

People of type θ earn flow utility uθ (ct ; σt ), which depends on their risky behavior ct and their state
τ
σt . People discount the future at rate δ and maximize expected lifetime utility ∑∞
τ=t δ uθ (cτ ; στ ).

Define Vθ (σ ) as the expected lifetime utility of a person currently in state σ ; note that this also
implicitly depends on current and future population states ωθ σt . Being infected reduces utility, so
we assume Vθ (S) > Vθ (I).
We focus on Susceptible people, as they comprise most of the population during the period we
study. We can write their maximization problem as a Bellman equation, in which people maximize
the sum of utility from risky behavior today and expected future utility:

marginal infection probability private cost of infection

The first-order condition shows that people choose their risky behavior to equate marginal benefit (more utility today) with private marginal cost (higher risk of infection, which reduces future
utility). The equation illustrates that there are three reasons why risky behavior might vary across
types. First is the marginal utility of risk (or equivalently, the marginal cost of social distancing):
for example, people vary in how much they like travel and dining out, as well as in how easy it is
to work from home. Second is the marginal infection probability: for example, local infection rate
it differs across geographic areas. Third is the private cost of infection: for example, infection is
more harmful for people who are older or have underlying health conditions.
3.3

Social Optimum

It is difficult to know for sure whether people take too many or too few steps to reduce disease
transmission during our study period. Thus, we do not consider the optimal consumption of c.
Instead, we hold constant the total amount of risky behavior and ask whether the allocation across
types is optimal. Tangibly, this means that we are not asking, “how much social distancing should
people be doing?” Instead, we are asking, “holding constant the amount of social distancing people
are doing, would some people ideally be doing less, and others ideally be doing more?”
Social welfare is the sum of utility across all people in all states:
Wt = ∑ ∑ ωθ σt Vθ (σt ).

(3)

θ σ

Let Ct denote the total risky behavior at time t across all people. The (constrained) socially optimal
outcome results from maximizing Wt subject to the constraint that Ct = C̄t . Let λ be the shadow
price on that constraint; this reflects the loss from having too much or too little social distancing
overall.
Consuming c imposes two types of externalities. First, it imposes a positive pecuniary ex7

ternality, as travel, dining out, and other risky activities help keep firms in business and workers
employed. Second, it imposes a negative externality by increasing the person’s infection probability, which increases the expected stock of infected people in the next period (it+1 ), which increases
other Susceptible people’s infection risk. Let φt denote the net externality per unit of consumption,
which may be positive or negative; this becomes more negative as the contagion externality grows.
We assume that these externalities are constant across people, and that people do not account for
them when setting their ct∗ .
In the constrained social optimum, Susceptible people’s consumption of ct would satisfy the
following first-order condition:

Heterogeneous Risk Misperceptions

We now allow people to misperceive risks. These misperceptions cause people to choose too much
or too little risky behavior relative to their private optimum, and heterogeneous misperceptions
cause transfers across types and efficiency losses.
We now add θ subscripts to explicitly denote different parameters by type. Let µtθ := β it δ (Vθ (S) −Vθ (I))
denote type θ ’s expected utility cost due to infection from an additional unit of risky consumption.
Let µ̃tθ denote type θ ’s perception of that cost. Susceptible type θ consumers then set ctθ according to the following modified first-order condition:
u0θ = µ̃tθ ,

(5)

giving consumption denoted ctθ

For illustrative purposes, imagine that there are two types θ ∈ {a, b} in equal proportion, and
that period t marginal utility is linear and the same for both types, so u0θ (c) = u0 (c) for both types
and u00 is a constant. Finally, without loss of generality, assume that type a perceives greater risk,
so µ̃aθ > µ̃bθ . Our survey data show that Democrats perceive greater risk, so one can think of
Democrats as type a. We do not take a stand on which type perceives risk more correctly or which
type’s behavior is closer to the unconstrained social optimum.
Define µ̃¯ t := 1 (µ̃ta + µ̃tb ) as the average risk perception. With homogeneous risk perceptions,
2

both types would set ct such that u0 = µ̃¯ t , giving homogeneous consumption denoted c̄t . With
8

These consumption differences cause both transfers across types

and efficiency losses.
Risk perceptions affect risky consumption, and risky consumption causes externalities, so the
heterogeneous misperceptions cause transfers across groups. The net transfer from type a to type

externality

If φt > 0, i.e. the positive pecuniary externality from risky consumption outweighs the negative
contagion externality, then heterogeneous misperceptions cause a net transfer from type b to type a.
Intuitively, we would say that Republicans are doing more to keep the economy going. On the other
hand, if φt < 0, i.e. the negative contagion externality outweighs the positive pecuniary externality,
then heterogeneous misperceptions cause a net transfer from type a to type b. Intuitively, we would
say that Democrats are doing more to reduce the spread of disease.

slope of private marginal utility

Intuitively, type a people (Democrats) are doing too much social distancing, and type b (Republicans) too little, relative to the (constrained) social optimum with homogeneous risk perceptions.
The marginal cost of social distancing is increasing: it’s easy to start by avoiding going to a bar
once a week, but eventually one’s only contact with people is going to the grocery store for food,
and it is quite costly to stop buying food. Thus, society could achieve the same amount of social
distancing at lower cost if type a did less and type b did more.
This model informs the empirical tests in the rest of the paper. In Section 6, we ask if Democrats
and Republicans have different risk perceptions, which would generate the transfers and efficiency
costs described above. In doing so, we control for factors such as population density that could

9

generate difference in actual risks across types. In Sections 5 and 6, we ask if Democrats and
Republicans are reducing risk by different amounts. In doing so, we use proxies to control for
differences in actual risks and marginal costs of risk reduction that could cause differential risk
reduction to be socially optimal.

Data
SafeGraph Mobile GPS Location Data

Our analysis uses GPS data from SafeGraph, aggregating GPS pings from numerous mobile applications to measure foot traffic patterns to a collection of points-of-interest (POIs). POIs include
retail shops, restaurants, movie theaters, hospitals, and many other public locations individuals
may choose to go when leaving their house. For each POI, SafeGraph reports its geographic location, industry, and the total number of visitors in their mobile device panel that have visited each
day.3 SafeGraph also provides the number of visitors traveling from a given home census block
group (CBG) to a given POI over the course of a week or month.4
Our primary analysis uses data from a period of nine weeks, from January 26 to March 28,
2020. We aggregate visits across all POIs in a given county for a given week. We also separately
aggregate visits by 2-digit NAICS code for each county and week. In a placebo analysis, we
analyze data over earlier time periods (starting in January 2019).
We also use data from the SafeGraph Social Distancing data released as a part of their COVID19 response. This data is available since February 1, 2020 and updated regularly. We use data
through March 30, 2020, which gives us nine weeks of data.5 This data contains alternative measures of social distancing beyond POI visits, such as the number of devices leaving their assigned
geohash-7 home or the median time spent away from home across devices.
See the Appendix for additional information on the SafeGraph data construction.
We supplement the SafeGraph data with various other sources of county and census block
group data. For demographic information on age, race, education, income, and poverty status at
3 SafeGraph

removes POIs with fewer than five visitors in a given month for data through February 2020. For the
March 2020 data, SafeGraph has released data on a weekly basis, rather than a monthly basis, and include all POIs
with at least 1 visitor for these weekly releases.
4 To preserve anonymity, SafeGraph removes home CBG↔POI pairs with fewer than five visitors in a given month for
data through February 2020. For the March 2020 data, SafeGraph has released data on a weekly basis, rather than a
monthly basis, and again excludes CBG↔POI pairs with fewer than 5 visitors over this (now weekly) time horizon.
5 The last week of our social distancing data only contains March 28th through March 30th.

the county-level, we aggregate census block group data from SafeGraph Open Census to the county
level.6 For each county, we define county partisanship to be the proportion of total votes received
by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election (MIT Election Data and Science Lab 2018). We
use county-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from The New York Times (2020).
4.2

Survey

To supplement these data, we run an online survey with a sample of American adults to study
partisan gaps in beliefs about and responses to COVID-19 at the individual level. The survey was
conducted from April 4-6 on CloudResearch’s Prime Panels, a market research firm with access to
50 million participants. As of April 6, we have recruited 1,665 participants to complete the study.
Participants are broadly representative of U.S. adults in terms of party affiliation, age, gender, and
race.7 Subjects who completed the survey are paid a show-up fee from CloudResearch and have
the chance to earn additional bonus incentives of up to $100.
Participants were asked for their party affiliation on a seven-point scale, ranging from “Strongly
Democrat” to “Strongly Republican.” We interpret party continuously, where 0 represents “Strongly
Democrat” and 6 represents “Strongly Republican.” We also classify participants into Republican
(including independents who lean Republican) and Democrats (including independents who lean
Democrat) for some analyses; there are 40 percent and 47 percent of these groups respectively.
The survey asked for demographic information (zipcode, age, race, gender, income, education,
number of children, and health). It then asked about news consumption habits and trust before and
during COVID-19. Then, there are several questions about social distancing: self-reported social
distancing in response to COVID-19, beliefs about the risk of not distancing, and the appropriate
trade-off between going out more to help the economy versus going out less to avoid spreading
COVID-19.
We next elicited beliefs about the number of new COVID-19 cases that would be confirmed in
the US in April, 2020, as well as the approval rating of Donald Trump’s response to the pandemic
on April 30, and randomly vary whether these are incentivized or not. 847 (51 percent) of subjects
make incentivized predictions in which they earn more money if they are closer to the correct
answer. They are told that we will randomly select 10 participants who will receive a payment

SafeGraph Empirical Specification and Results

Figure 4 reports trends in social distancing and COVID-19 prevalence separately for Republican
and Democratic counties, defined to be counties above or below the median 2016 Republican vote
share respectively. Panel A shows that the overall number of POI visits is relatively constant until
COVID-19 cases begin emerging in the United States in March. During this same period, Democratic counties exhibited a sharper drop in weekly POI visits than their Republican counterparts.
As Panel B demonstrates, Democratic counties also exhibited a much sharper rise in COVID-19
cases and deaths—accounting for nearly all verified COVID-19 cases and deaths through March
22. Appendix Figure A1 shows that these declining and differential POI trends are not present over
the same time period in 2019.
Our main empirical specification takes the following form
log(cit ) = αt ρi + Xit · γt + εit ,
where cit is the number of POI visits in county i during week t, αt are the time-varying coefficients
on county partisanship ρi , Xit are potentially time-varying controls, and εit is the county-specific
error term.8 In choosing our control variables Xit , we chose variables to flexibly control for the
four channels of divergent behavior highlighted in equation (2). Standard errors are clustered at
the county-level throughout unless specified otherwise.
Figure 5 reports our estimates of αt under various sets of covariates chosen to incrementally
control for the mechanisms highlighted by our model.
In Panel A, we only include county and time fixed effects. This measures the extent to which
these two groups’ behavior diverges with the rise of COVID-19 via any of the aforementioned
channels. Throughout February, there are no significant partisan differences in POI visits relative
to the January 26 week baseline. However, as COVID-19 begins to emerge in the United States,
partisan differences arise and grow throughout the weeks of March.
8 In

implementing, we normalize αt relative to the first week.

12

These results do not control for differences in state policies, which themselves may be a function of the partisan leanings of government officials. In Panel B, adding state-time fixed effects
to control for state-level policies in response to COVID-19 along with other state-level temporal
shocks causes the partisan differences to attenuate slightly.
In Panel C, we flexibly control for various health9 and economic10 characteristics of the county.
We view the health controls as proxies for the marginal infection probability and the private cost of
infection, and we view the economic controls as proxies for the marginal cost of social distancing,
though each group of controls could proxy for other factors as well. We allow the coefficient on
these variables γt to vary flexibly across time.
Although these controls attenuates the partisan differences to some degree, they remain economically and statistically significant. By the week of March 22, our estimate of αt is 0.419. This
implies that going from a county with the 10th to the 90th percentile in Republican vote share is
associated with an 16.7 percent increase in the number of POI visits during the week of March
22.11 Appendix Figure A2 shows that these strong partisan differences do not appear over the
same time period in 2019. We view these results as evidence of behavioral differences driven by
partisan misperceptions of risks at the group-level, consistent with the survey evidence.
In Appendix Figure A3, we report sensitivity to various alternative specifications. Panels A
and B use alternative sets of controls. Panel C replaces the measure of partisanship with a discrete
indicator for certain quantiles of the Republican vote share distribution. Panel D drops counties with populations above half a million or states with early COVID-19 outbreaks (California,
Washington, and New York). Panel E restricts the sample to counties from certain portions of the
Republican vote share distribution. And, Panel F weights observations by the county’s population,
uses standard errors clustered at the state-level, and examines sensitivity to the start date. None of
the alternative specifications change the central conclusion regarding partisan differences in social
distancing in March.
Figure 6 examines heterogeneity across 2-digit NAICS codes by re-aggregating POI visits to
the county level after restricting to certain NAICS codes. Consistent with the narrative around
COVID-19, we see the strongest partisan differences emerge with POIs in the accommodations

controls include log of one plus the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county, the log of one plus
the number of COVID-19 deaths in the county, the log of one plus the county population density (individuals per
square kilometer) and the share of the population 65 years or older
10 Economic controls include the share of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree, the share in poverty, and the
shares of white, black, and asians.

and food, entertainment, and retail industries. There are no significant partisan differences in visits
to health care POIs.
Figure 7 repeats Panel C of 5, but using POI visits aggregated at the day level. The partisan
differences emerge in March for both weekdays and weekends, suggesting these differences are
not driven solely by differences in work-from-home policies.
Figure 8 considers various alternative measures of social distancing derived from SafeGraph’s
Social Distancing data release as described in Section 4. Statistically significant partisan differences emerge in March for the log number of devices leaving home, the share of devices leaving
home, and the total number of active devices.12 For the log of the median time away from home,
we see positive, but insignificant, point estimates.

Survey Results

Turning to the results of our survey, we first consider beliefs about future COVID-19 cases in the
US. We tell participants the number of cases by March 31 and ask them to predict the number of
cases in April. For half of subjects, these predictions are incentivized. We find that Democrats
anticipate more future COVID-19 cases. On average, Republicans predict 188,678 cases (s.e.
8,069 cases) and Democrats predict 13 percent more cases (213,761 cases; s.e. 8,211 cases).13
The difference between these predictions is 25,083 cases (s.e. 11,512 cases; p = 0.030).
Next, we consider how Republicans and Democrats differ in their perceptions of the risk of not
socially distancing, and find that that Democrats believe that the probability of catching COVID-19
in one month without any social distancing is higher than Republicans do. On average, Republicans
assess this probability to be 19.8 percent (s.e. 1.1 percent), and Democrats assess this probability
to be 24.8 percent (s.e. 1.1 percent). The difference between these estimates is 5.0 percentage
points (s.e. 1.5 percentage points; p = 0.001). We see also see small differences in self-reported
actions. On average, Republicans report reducing their contact with others over one month by 70.1
12 A

key issue with the SafeGraph social distancing data is sample attrition. SafeGraph restricts the panel to devices
with observed location pings in a given time period. For some applications, the frequency of location pings depends
on device mobility. If devices are immobile at home or turned off, they may not generate location pings and would
then be dropped from the sample. The total number of active devices changes over our sample period in a manner
consistent with sample attrition. Given these issues, we prefer measures of social distancing derived solely from
external activity (e.g., POI visits) that do not contain the same measurement error problems. We attempt to correct
for the differential attrition in our measure of the share of devices leaving home (see Figure 8 footnotes for correction;
see Panel G of Appendix Figure A3 for estimates using the uncorrected measure).
13 As pre-specified, these averages are calculated after winsorizing at the 5-percent level to account for outliers.

percent (s.e. 1.0 percent), and Democrats report reductions of 71.5 percent (s.e. 0.8 percent). The
difference between these reductions is 1.4 percent, but not statistically significant (s.e. 1.3 percent;
p = 0.277).
We next consider Republicans’ and Democrats’ perceptions of the tradeoff between going outside and supporting the economy, versus staying inside and avoiding the spread of COVID-19.
Participants were asked to answer which was more important on a seven-point scale, which we
normalize to the unit interval. We find that a majority of participants of both parties find it more
important to stay inside to stop the virus from spreading, but that they differ in their strength of
opinion. Republicans on average give an answer that leans 80.6 percent of the way towards staying
inside (s.e. 1.0 percent), while Democrats give an answer that leans 83.8 percent towards staying inside (0.9 percent). The difference between these answers is 3.2 percentage points (s.e. 1.3
percentage points; p = 0.017).
These results seem to indicate that Democratic participants generally expect COVID-19 to
spread more, and be a greater threat, as compared to Republican participants. However, as with
past surveys, there is a confound that Democrats tend to live in areas that are generally more
susceptible to COVID-19. There may also be other demographic, health, or location differences
between Republicans and Democrats that contribute to these gaps in beliefs and attitudes.
In Figure 9, we normalize participants’ responses on the previous four questions, control for a
large set of control variables (including population density), and weight data to mimic a nationallyrepresentative sample on age, race, gender, and party. We find that the results persist, and that the
control variables do not qualitatively change the predictions from the raw data.
Lastly, we ask whether the partisan gap in beliefs about the number of US cases shrinks when
subjects are given incentives for accuracy. Bullock et al. (2015) and Prior et al. (2015) show
that partisan differences on factual questions often shrink under incentives, and interpret this as
evidence that the differences in survey responses are partly due to “partisan cheerleading” rather
than differences in true beliefs. As shown in Figure 10, we find that on an explicitly political
question (Trump’s approval rating for his handling of COVID-19), incentives reduce the partisan
gap, consistent with the findings in Bullock et al. (2015) and Prior et al. (2015). However, the
partisan gap in predicted future cases if anything widens with incentives. This supports the view
that Democrats and Republicans genuinely differ in their beliefs about the severity of the outbreak.

Conclusion

Divergent messages from political leaders and media outlets about the severity of COVID-19 have
the potential to seriously undermine the country’s response to the pandemic. If citizens on the left
and the right disagree about the potential risks, they may also diverge in their compliance with
critical social distancing measures. Many lives could be lost relative to a benchmark where the
same overall level of social distancing was efficiently allocated between the two groups.
Our empirical results show that partisan gaps in beliefs and behavior are real. GPS evidence
reveals large partisan gaps in actual social distancing behaviors. Survey evidence shows substantial
gaps between Republicans and Democrats in beliefs about severity and the importance of social
distancing. The raw partisan differences partly reflect the fact that Democrats are more likely to
live in the dense, urban areas hardest hit by the crisis, and to be subject to policy restrictions—in
other words, to face stronger individual incentives for social distancing. Even after controlling
carefully for such factors, however, the partisan gaps remain statistically and economically significant. While our evidence does not permit us to conclusively pin down the ultimate causes
of partisan divergence, the patterns are consistent with the messaging from politicians and media
having played an important role.

aggregate visits between the week beginning January 26, 2020 and the week beginning March 22,
2020. Blue shading denotes a more negative percent change in visits during the latter week relative
to the former. Red shading indicates an increase or a smaller decrease in visits. These visits are
sourced from SafeGraph’s mobile device location data. Panel B maps counties by the percentage of
votes Donald Trump received in the 2016 presidential election. Red shading in this panel indicates
more Republican counties (higher Trump vote share), and blue shading indicates more Democratic
counties (lower Trump vote share).

Note: Figure shows the estimated coefficients for county partisanship ρi on the log number of
POI visits in the county after restricting POI visits to various 2-digit NAICS codes. The NAICS
code groups are: Accomodation and Food (NAICS 72), Entertainment (NAICS 71), Retail Trade
(NAICS 44 and 45), Health Care (NAICS 62), and Other Industries (All NAICS codes not previously used). The same controls are used as in Panel C of Figure 5. The grey error bars indicate 95
percent confidence intervals constructed using standard errors clustered at the county-level.

Note: This figure shows coefficient plots of regressing normalized measures of beliefs and actions
on party. Positive values indicate less concern about COVID-19 or social distancing. Demographic
controls are age, race, income, education, number of children, ZIP code logged population density,
state. 2 percent of observations are dropped for not including a valid ZIP code. Predicted US cases
are predictions about the number of new COVID-19 cases in the US in April; self-reported social
distancing is the percent reduction in contact with others over one month; effectiveness of distancing is the estimated likelihood of catching COVID-19 in one month without social distancing;
importance of distancing vs. economy is subjects’ perception of whether it is more important to
go out and stimulate the economy versus staying in and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Error

Note: This plot shows coefficient plots of regressing beliefs on party, with and without incentives
for getting close to the correct answer. Trump disapproval is a low-stakes question that is susceptible to partisan cheerleading (Bullock et al. 2015; Prior et al. 2015). These results show that
predicting COVID-19 cases does not appear susceptible to the same behavior. Error bars represent

Data Details
County-Level Data Build (POI)

To construct the county-level POI dataset used in the analysis, we proceeded as follows:
1. We use county data on 2016 Presidential votes shares (MIT Election Data and Science Lab
2018). We define the Republican vote share to be the share of votes received by the Republican candidate over the sum of votes across all candidates. We exclude Alaska, and merge
with the 2010 TIGER county shapefile.14 Two counties in the shapefile do not have valid
vote data (FIPS: 15005, 51515).
2. We then use the latitude and longitude in the the Core POI dataset from SafeGraph to match
POIs to counties. We successfully assign more than 99.9 percent of the POIs to a county.
3. We merge the output from (2) with the Patterns dataset from SafeGraph using the safegraphplace-id variable. We drop all observations with invalid vote shares at this stage. Using the
March 22 week as an example, we only lose 0.34 percent of daily POI observations with
these steps.
4. We use the Open Census data from SafeGraph to construct a county-level dataset of demographic information at the county level. We do this by aggregating up the data given at the
census block group level to the county level. We then merge the county demographic information with the output from (3). We successfully match all but one county in this merge.
5. We then merge The New York Times COVID-19 tracking data onto our output from (4). We
assume zero cases and deaths for the observations not observed in The New York Times data.
We drop the five counties associated with New York City and the four counties which overlap
with Kansas City (MO), because The New York Times lists these as geographic exceptions
where it either does not assign cases to these counties or excludes cases occurring within the
city.
A.1.2

County-Level Data Build (Social Distancing)

To construct the county-level social distancing dataset used in this analysis, we proceeded as follows:

14 Downloaded

from https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf counties.html on July 24, 2018.

32

1. We use the Daily Social Distancing SafeGraph data with observations at the census block
group-day level for February 1 through March 30. We drop duplicate observations and exclude Alaska. We restrict our sample to census block groups with active devices throughout
the entire time period. We also drop one census block group with anomalous behavior as
notified by SafeGraph (FIPS: 190570010001).
2. We then aggregate to the county level. For the ‘device count’ and ‘completely home device
count’ variables, we take the sum. For the ‘median home dwell time’ variable we take the
mean weighted by ‘the device count’ in the census block group.
3. We then follow steps (4) and (5) described in Section A.1.1.
4. Lastly, we merge on 2016 Presidential vote shares, only keeping observations with valid vote
shares.

Note: Figure shows the estimated coefficients for county partisanship ρi on the log number of POI visits in the county. The specifications are
analogous to our baseline in Panel C of Figure 5 except with the following deviations.

•

Panel A: The first plot drops the COVID-19 cases and deaths controls; the second plot drops the economic controls; and the third plot
drops all of the health controls, including the COVID-19 ones.

•

Panel B: The first plot does not allow the coefficients on the controls to vary over time and interacts time-invariant controls with a linear
time trend; the second plot adds the share Hispanic and the share with income less than 60k with time-varying coefficients; and the third
plot drops the state-time fixed effects.

•

Panel C: The first plot defines partisanship ρi to be 1 if Trump’s vote share is greater than the median and -1 otherwise; the second plot
defines partisanship ρi to be 1 if Trump’s vote share is in the top quartile, -1 if in the bottom quartile, and 0 otherwise; and the third plot
defines partisanship ρi to be 1 if Trump’s vote share is in the top decile, -1 if in the bottom decile, and 0 otherwise.
