Abstract
We study the role of global supply chains in the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on GDP
growth for 64 countries. We discipline the labor supply shock across sectors and countries using
the fraction of work in the sector that can be done from home, interacted with the stringency
with which countries imposed lockdown measures. Using the quantitative framework and methods
developed in Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020), we show that the average real GDP
downturn due to the Covid-19 shock is expected to be

−29.6%,

with one quarter of the total

due to transmission through global supply chains. However, renationalization of global supply
chains does not in general make countries more resilient to pandemic-induced contractions in
labor supply.

The average GDP drop would have been

−30.2%

in a world without trade in

inputs and nal goods. This is because eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance
on the domestic inputs, which are also disrupted due to nationwide lockdowns. In fact, trade can
insulate a country imposing a stringent lockdown from the pandemic-shock, as its foreign inputs
are less disrupted than its domestic ones. Finally, unilateral lifting of the lockdowns in the largest
economies can contribute as much as 2.5% to GDP growth in some of their smaller trade partners.

1 Introduction
Much of the world is closely integrated through nal and intermediate goods trade.

As countries

simultaneously curtail economic activity by means of domestic lockdown policies, the global economic
downturn may therefore be exacerbated by reductions in the supply of foreign intermediates, or
demand for a country's exports abroad (Baldwin, 2020). As a result, there is now a great deal of
speculation in both policy circles and popular press that the experience of the pandemic will in the
medium term lead to a renationalization of supply chains.

1

However, it is an open question whether

supply chain renationalization would make GDP more resilient to pandemic-type shocks.

A shift

from foreign to domestic intermediates would also change the relative size and shock responsiveness
of domestic sectors, and thus aect the reaction of the economy to a pandemic.
This paper quanties the role of the global supply chains in the economic impact of the Covid-19
pandemic using a model of world production and trade covering 64 countries on all continents and 33
sectors spanning all economic activities. We parameterize the model using the OECD Inter-Country
Input-Output (ICIO) Tables, that provide matrices of domestic and international intermediate input and nal use trade.

We solve the model analytically using the techniques developed in Huo,

Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020).
We start by simulating a global lockdown as a contraction in labor supply. To discipline the relative
size of the labor contraction, we combine two pieces of information. First, we use the Dingel and
Neiman (2020) measure of the fraction of the work of dierent occupations that can be done at home.
Variation across sectors in their occupation usage and of countries in their sectoral employment
composition results in heterogeneous incidence of the shock across countries. Second, countries also
vary in the stringency of lockdown measures.

To capture this, we interact the work-from-home

intensity by occupation with an index capturing the country-level lockdown stringency from Hale
et al. (2020). Since this index is not a cardinal measure, we apply a monotonic transformation to
match the mean and the dispersion of the drop in Industrial Production in a subsample of countries
where these data are available. Though we do not target country-specic output changes, the model
predictions t the data well.
Not surprisingly, the model produces a large contraction of economic activity, with an average

29.6%

GDP drop in our sample of countries for the duration of the shock. Our focus is on the role of the
global supply chains in particular. To better understand how linkages between countries amplify or
mitigate the eect of the shock, we report two results. First, we compute the share of each country's
GDP contraction that is due to foreign, rather than domestic shocks. On average, about

23.3%

of

the contraction of GDP comes from foreign shocks.
Second, we answer the more substantive question of whether participation in global supply chains

exacerbated or alleviated the pandemic-induced contraction in labor supply. Figuring this out requires comparing the pandemic-induced GDP change in the baseline model to the pandemic-induced
GDP change in an alternative world without international trade, where supply chains have adjusted
to use only domestic inputs.
We nd that on average in our 64 countries the downturn would actually be slightly worse with
renationalized supply chains (−30.2%) than under current levels of trade. The reason is that eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases the reliance on domestic inputs. Since a pandemic-related
lockdown also aects domestic sectors, there is generally no resilience benet from renationalizing
the international supply chains.
There is a distribution of dierences around the average.
5-8 percentage points

more

In some countries GDP would drop by

if supply chains were renationalized, whereas in others GDP would fall

by about 4 percentage points

less.

The cross-country variation is well-explained by dierences in

lockdown severity across countries. Some countries  most prominently Japan, Taiwan, Sweden, or
Greece  impose less stringent lockdowns in response to the pandemic shock. The domestic pandemicinduced shock is therefore smaller in these countries than the shock to their trading partners with
more severe lockdowns. Separating from the global supply chains would make these countries more
resilient to lockdowns by eliminating the transmission of the relatively larger shock from other countries.

By contrast, a country with the most severe lockdown will reduce its own domestic labor

supply by more than its average trading partner. In that case, the supply of the domestic intermediate inputs falls by more than the supply of foreign ones, and thus the GDP contraction is larger when
supply chains are renationalized. Thus, whether renationalizing supply chains insulates a country
from the pandemic depends on whether it plans to impose a more or less severe lockdown than its
trading partners.
It may be that while renationalizing all supply chains is not on average benecial, doing so in specic
sectors would improve resilience.

To investigate this possibility, we renationalize supply chains in

individual sectors one by one. There is no sector in which supply chain renationalization notably
improves resilience, measured either by GDP, or by value added of the sector itself.
Next, we address the interaction between the health crisis and global supply chains, by simulating
the lockdown in an environment of increased demand for health services.

We rst construct an

alternative high-health economy, in which the share of nal expenditure that goes to the Health
sector doubles in each country.

We then simulate the pandemic-driven labor supply contraction

in the baseline and high-health economies, and compare the results.

Because the Health sector

is not subject to the lockdown, the GDP contraction is modestly less severe in the high-health
scenario (average about 1 percentage point smaller contraction). Since the Health sector is largely
non-tradeable, increasing its size does not have a consistent impact on the relative importance of
international transmission.

2

Our last counterfactual tackles the recovery from the shock. Currently, countries decide on lifting
the lockdowns without international coordination. We thus simulate individual countries' decisions
to unilaterally allow workers to return to work, while the rest of the world remains in lockdown. Our
quantication suggests that most of the GDP impacts of the lockdown are domestic, and these are
reversed by reopening. We show that the unilateral reopenings of smaller countries such as Norway
or Austria (examples of countries who are currently rolling back lockdowns) have limited impacts on
GDP in other countries. By contrast, even unilateral reopening of large economies like China, US,
Germany, or Russia would have a noticeable impact on others. These countries' opening can raise
GDP in some of the most tightly linked countries by up to 2.5%.
We highlight that our exercises do not take into account the health consequences of the pandemic
itself, nor do we model the labor supply shock as being conditional on the infection rate in the
population.

We view this as reasonable in the current context where a very small fraction of the

population in most countries is directly aected by the disease at any point in time. Note that incorporating the infection rate into the calibration would only amplify the aggregate labor supply shock
and the GDP consequences in the baseline. We take this approach as most of our counterfactuals are
meant to capture the very short-run impact consequences of the shock. During the impact period,
infection rates are low and most of the labor force is not incapacitated.
Related Literature

Our paper complements the burgeoning body of work on the macroeconomic

impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (see, among others, Acemoglu et al., 2020; Atkeson, 2020; Alvarez,
Argente, and Lippi, 2020; Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt, 2020; Glover et al., 2020; Kaplan,
Moll, and Violante, 2020; Krueger, Uhlig, and Xie, 2020). Most closely related are Baqaee and Farhi
(2020a,b) and Barrot, Grassi, and Sauvagnat (2020), who study the eects of the lockdown on GDP
declines in input network economies, and Çakmakl et al. (2020), who explore transmission of demand
shocks in a small open economy context. Our focus is the international dimension of transmission
through global supply chains.
In that respect, we build on the the active recent research agenda on international shock propagation
in production networks.

We apply the framework and tools developed in Huo, Levchenko, and

Pandalai-Nayar (2020), who study the sources of international GDP comovement in a general multicountry multi-sector multi-factor model with input linkages.

Also closely related is Baqaee and

Farhi (2019) and Allen, Arkolakis, and Takahashi (2020), who explore the impact of productivity,
factor supply, and trade cost shocks in a wide class of open-economy models. Our counterfactuals
simulate the labor supply shocks in an environment with endogenous labor supply, allowing for

2

propagation through input networks.

Our analysis also relates to recent papers studying the short-

The notion that international input trade is the key feature of the global economy goes back to Hummels, Ishii,

and Yi (2001) and Yi (2003), and has more recently been documented and quantied in a series of contributions by
Johnson and Noguera (2012, 2017) and Caliendo and Parro (2015). Burstein, Kurz, and Tesar (2008), Bems, Johnson,
and Yi (2010), Johnson (2014), Eaton et al. (2016), and Eaton, Kortum, and Neiman (2016), among others, explore

run transmission and amplication of a natural disaster shock through trade linkages (Barrot and
Sauvagnat, 2016; Carvalho et al., 2016; Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar, 2019). In contrast to
these papers, the Covid-19 pandemic oers a unique opportunity to quantify the consequences of a
synchronized labor supply shock. As highlighted by Imbs (2004) and Huo, Levchenko, and PandalaiNayar (2020), both correlated shocks and transmission lead to synchronization of GDP growth, and
the relative importance of the two is a quantitative question.

We highlight two features of our preference formulation that will be important for the analysis that

labor mobility in the short run, appropriate in this application. Second, the labor supply is subject
to country-occupation-specic shocks

ξn` .

This exibility is needed to capture the fact that not all

occupations experienced the same contractions in labor supply, as some jobs can be more easily done
at home. In a similar vein, there is heterogeneity in lockdown severity across countries, that once
again can be captured by variation in

Analytical Solution

We now provide an analytical expression for the global inuence matrix.

In general, closed-form

solutions for the exact inuence vectors cannot be obtained in multi-country multi-sector models
such as ours. However, Huo, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) show that in this framework we
can solve for the rst-order approximation of the inuence vector. Denote by ln the log-deviation
from steady state/pre-shock equilibrium.

In addition, η and α are matrices of output elasticities, Πf and Πx are matrices of nal consumption

of sectoral employment shares by occupation, and P summarizes how prices respond to output changes
8

which combines both structural elasticities and spending shares.5
Equations (2.7)-(2.9) illustrate that all we need to understand the response of worldwide output to
various occupation-country shocks in this quantitative framework are measures of steady state nal
goods consumption and production shares, the distribution of occupations across sectors, as well as
model elasticities. We refer to the matrix

of worldwide labor inputs to the worldwide vector of shocks as the

The expression in (2.8) is a block diagonal matrix, implying a null partial equilibrium response to
foreign shocks. Once we allow the goods markets to respond, the global supply chain starts to play
a role and transmission across countries will be present. The matrix

(I − G)−1

encodes the general

equilibrium response of sectoral labor composite in a country to shocks in any sector-country, taking
into account the full model structure and all direct and indirect links between the countries and
sectors.

The model solution (2.7)-(2.9) resembles the typical solution to a network model, that

writes the equilibrium change in output as a product of the Leontief inverse and the vector of shocks.
Our expression also features a vector of shocks, and an inverse of a matrix that is more complicated
due to the multi-country structure of our model combined with elastic factor supply and non-unitary
elasticities of substitution.
The main advantage of the rst-order solution above is transparency. The GDP change is represented
as a linear combination of primitive shocks, allowing additive decompositions of the GDP change
that illuminate the forces at work.

An alternative is an exact solution of the model.

It also underscores

that the exact general equilibrium feedback eects hinge on various steady-state shares. When the
nal goods or intermediate goods aggregates deviate from the Cobb-Douglas case, the global goods
demand system (2.3) is more complex and the matrix

P

that governs the responses of prices enters

the inuence matrix (2.7).
2.3

Accounting Decompositions

To illustrate how we will use the model above to understand the impact of global supply chains on
GDP growth during the pandemic, we next present some simple accounting decompositions of domestic GDP growth. These build on the more general accounting framework used in Huo, Levchenko,
and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) to study GDP comovement.
The linear representation of the GDP change in country

n as a function of the global vector of shocks

(2.6)-(2.9) lends itself to an additive decomposition of the GDP change into the components due to
domestic and foreign shocks. To rst order, the log deviation of real GDP of country

n

from steady

state can be written as:

ln Vn ≈

Renationalization of global supply chains

There is now a great deal of speculation in policy

circles and popular press that the pandemic will lead to a renationalization of the global supply
chains, to protect against similar shocks in the future. In our model transmission is positive, in the
sense that an adverse foreign shock lowers a country's GDP. The sign and size of the contribution of
foreign shocks is informative, but does not imply that the presence of global value chains exacerbated
the GDP contraction due to the lockdown.
To establish this type of result, we need to compare the contraction in the baseline model to an
alternative in which the global supply chains have been renationalized. We construct such a version
of the world economy by raising iceberg trade costs to innity in both intermediate and nal good
uses. We then shock each country with the same size lockdown as in the baseline world economy.
If the GDP contraction with renationalized supply chains is smaller than the one in the baseline,
we conclude that a country's participation in the global value chains exacerbated the downturn,
and vice versa. To understand the results that appear below, we can write the GDP change in the
renationalized equilibrium (R) following the shock as:

ln VnR =

X

sR
nn` ξn` ,

(2.13)

`
where

sR
nn`

is the elasticity of country

n's

GDP to a shock in occupation

`

in the renationalized

equilibrium. By denition, in this case the country is immune to foreign shocks, and only responds
to domestic shocks.
Comparing (2.12) and (2.13), the dierence in the GDP response in the baseline relative to autarky
is a sum of two parts:

X

ln Vn − ln VnR =


snn` − sR
nn` ξn` + Tn .

(2.14)

Change in Domestic Inuence
The second component,

Tn ,

is straightforward:

in autarky, the country is not subject to foreign

shocks, so holding all else xed the downturn is smaller in autarky if the rest of the world experiences
a bad shock.
However, the rst term captures an additional eect. Absent international trade, the responsiveness
of the economy to domestic shocks would also be dierent.

Some sectors grow in inuence as a

country opens to trade, others shrink. Whether or not participation in global trade exacerbates the
downturn is determined by how the altered sensitivity to domestic shocks (snn`

− sR
nn` )

compares to

the eliminated sensitivity to foreign shocks.
To better understand the change in the domestic inuence term, note that the change in the labor

11

input can be written as a sum of the partial and general equilibrium impacts of the shocks:

ln H = D ln ξ + Γ ln ξ

| {z }

Combining (2.6), (2.14), and (2.15), the dierence between the trade and the renationalized equilibria

(2.16)
The dierence in the GDP change between the trade and renationalized equilibria can be decomposed
into three eects. The PE eect captures the reweighting of the sectors towards, or away from, those
more exposed to the lockdown.

For instance, if when going from the renationalized to the trade

equilibrium Domar weights grow in sectors more immune to lockdowns, the country will be more
insulated from lockdowns under trade, all else equal.
The matrix governing the partial equilibrium response to shocks is simple:
construction,

D =

1+ψ O
κ+ψ Π .

By

D is block-diagonal by country, as only shocks to domestic occupational groups directly

aect domestic hours. It can be directly constructed from data on occupational shares and laborrelated elasticities, and thus does not require solving the model. The PE response matrix

D captures

the direct eect of the shocks to occupations in the home country on sectoral labor in the home
country.

That is, it traces the shift of the labor supply curve in occupation

holding all other

markets xed (including domestic labor markets in other occupations). The magnitude of this shift
is

(1 + ψ) ln ξn` ,

The domestic GE term captures the change in the general equilibrium eects of domestic shocks
between the two equilibria. It reects the fact that the renationalization of global supply chains will
rearrange domestic input usage, and as a result the impact of domestic shocks on the home economy.
The matrix of general equilibrium adjustments

Γ

includes the spillover eects to labor markets in

other occupations, and the indirect eects on domestic and global goods markets. Computing the
GE term term requires the solution to the full general equilibrium model, as it encodes the change
in the propagation of occupation-specic shocks through the rest of the economy through product

12

and labor market linkages.

3 Data and Calibration
Labor shock

To calibrate the size of the labor shock, we use three pieces of data.

The rst is

the classication of occupations by whether they can be performed at home by Dingel and Neiman
(2020).

9

We then combine this occupation-specic work from home intensity with the country-

specic lockdown intensity constructed by the Oxford Blavatnik School of Government Coronavirus
Government Response Tracker (Hale et al., 2020, henceforth GRT). This index ranges from 0 to 100,
and we treat it as a proportion indicator, 1 being a full lockdown. These data are recorded daily.
We take the maximum value in each country up to April 30, 2020.
While the variation across countries in lockdown severity can be captured by the GRT index, it is
not meant to be a cardinal measure, and the elasticity of the labor supply with respect to this index
is unknown. We thus curve the GRT index to t a lognormal distribution, where we choose the mean
and variance to match the mean and the range of the fall in the April 2020 Industrial Production

10

(IP) for the countries for which these data are currently available.
The labor supply shift in occupation

`

and country

n

relative to the pre-shock steady state is then:

ln ξn` = − (1 − work from home` ) × f (GRTn ) ,

(3.1)

The exception is the Health sector, which receives no labor supply shock as it is not subject to
lockdowns.

The robustness section below shows that none of the main conclusions change if we

simply treat the GRT index as a cardinal measure of the percentage of labor supply contraction
(f

(GRTn ) = GRTn ).11

The rst term in the curly brackets captures the impact of labor supply shocks on one occupation on demand for
other occupations' labor inputs. The second term reects the propagation of a supply shock to a particular occupation
through the input and nal goods markets worldwide.

9

We use Dingel and Neiman (2020)'s O*NET-derived classication.

Notice that in the context of the Covid-19

pandemic, this is a conservative shock, as school closures and other lockdown measures likely imply that the actual
occupation-related tasks performed at home are less than those that are feasible.

10

The advantage of IP data is that they are released promptly and are at the monthly frequency. The disadvantage

is that they only cover the manufacturing sector, and thus must be lined up with manufacturing sector output rather
than GDP in our model. We obtained April 2020 IP data for 39 of our 64 countries from the OECD, Eurostat, and
some national statistical agencies. The April 2020 IP contraction is dened as the log dierence with respect to the
maximum 3-month moving average in the previous 12 months (meant to capture contraction relative to the peak). See
appendix B.2 for details about the curving.

11

In practice, the adjustment to the average size of the shock to match the IP drop is minimal. Using the raw GRT

produces a 30.1% fall in manufacturing output in the set of countries for which we found IP data, compared to 28.7%
in the data. Using raw GRT undershoots the dispersion in IP changes across countries substantially.

the table reports the 10th and 90th percentiles of the range of these parameters. Alternative

parameters are considered in Appendix B.

Sectoral occupation composition

To compute the occupation shares by sector, we use US data

from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This dataset reports the number of workers in each occupation
employed in each NAICS sector, together with their average annual wage. We convert this to our
ISIC-based industry classication, and use it to compute the sectoral expenditure shares on each
occupation. Because workers in the health services are not aected by the lockdown measures, we
create a special composite health occupation that is used by the Health Services sector only, and
does not incur a negative labor supply shock. Our nal occupational classication is similar to the 23
SOC major groups, minus the Military-Specic Occupations and with an extra Health Composite
occupation.

Appendix Table A1 lists our occupational classication together with the work from

home intensities.

Since data on industry occupational composition are unavailable for countries

12

other than the US, we assume that the shares are similar across countries.
Trade, input, and consumption shares

The data requirements for calibrating this model is

the information on the world input-output matrix and nal use. We use the OECD Inter-Country
Input-Output (ICIO) Tables. These data cover 64 countries on all continents and 33 sectors spanning
the entire economy. We use the information for the latest available year, 2015. We separate the 33
sectors into 3 groups for nal consumption: Goods, Services, and Health. Appendix Table A2 lists
the countries, and Appendix Table A3 lists the sectors along with the breakdown into groups.

12

This is consistent with our assumption that sectoral production functions are the same across countries and the

elasticity of substitution across occupations equal to 1.

Huo, Levchenko,

between 1 and 2.75. Since

ours is a very short-run application, we take the lower value of 1, and apply it to all groups. We
set the intermediate input substitution elasticity

ε

to 0.5. The notion that inputs are complements

at business cycle frequencies is consistent with the estimates by Atalay (2017) and Boehm, Flaaen,
and Pandalai-Nayar (2019).

We calibrate the cross-group substitution elasticity

ρ

to 0.2 in our

baseline, following the estimates from the structural transformation literature suggesting that broad
services and manufacturing aggregates are complements (Herrendorf, Rogerson, and Valentinyi, 2013;
Cravino and Sotelo, 2019; Comin, Lashkari, and Mestieri, 2020). In the baseline we set the Frisch
labor supply elasticity
across occupations

κ

ψ

to

of 2 for all occupations. Finally, we set the sectoral elasticity of substitution

1,

close to the value of

0.9

found by Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2014).

As detailed in Sections 2.2-2.3, the magnitudes of domestic and international GE eects are governed
by these elasticities. Appendix B reports the results of our quantitative exercises under alternative
elasticities.
All other parameters in the model have close counterparts in basic data and thus we compute them
directly. Capital shares in total output

αj

and value added shares in gross output

ηj

come from the

KLEMS and OECD STAN databases, and are averaged in each sector across countries to reduce
noise.

3.1

Basic Facts

How economies react to the labor shock stemming from the pandemic depends on the fraction of
work that can be performed from home. Appendix Table A4 shows the sectoral shares of employees
whose occupation can be done from home, computed as a sector-specic weighted average of the
occupation measures.

There is substantial sectoral variation in the shares, ranging from 11% in

the accommodation and food services sector, to 90% in the IT sector. Overall, service sectors have
a higher share, with the notable exception of the Human Health and Social Work sector. Because
sectors have dierent labor shares, however, the share of work that cannot be done from home doesn't
precisely capture the exposure of a sector to the labor shock. The last column of the table displays
the sectoral exposure, dened as

(1 − αj )ηj (1 − work from homej ).

These are uniformly lower, since

the labor shares in gross output are far less than 1, but still feature considerable variation across
sectors.

Notes: This gure displays the share of foreign intermediate inputs as a share of sectoral intermediate purchases.

The blue dashed horizontal line is the cross-sector mean.

The eective severity of the labor supply shock will vary across countries as a function of both
sectoral composition and lockdown stringency.

Table 2 lists the top 10 and bottom 10 countries

according to the share of aggregate labor that can be performed at home. This share is computed
as the sectoral labor compensation-weighted average of the sectoral shares of work that can be done
from home. Among the top 10 are several developed economies such as the US, United Kingdom or
Luxembourg, consistent with their large service sector size. Table 2 also lists the top and bottom 10

countries in terms of lockdown stringency.
Exposure to foreign inputs will also determine the extent to which each country is aected by
international shock propagation.

Figure 1 displays the share of inputs that each country sources

from abroad. There is a fair bit of variation, ranging from less than 10% in countries least integrated
into global supply chains to over 50% in the most integrated countries. Figure 2 displays the world
average of same measure at the sectoral level.

As expected, manufacturing sectors tend to have

higher imported input shares than services.

4 Main Results
GDP contraction and the contribution of foreign shocks

The blue-white combination bars

in the top panel of Figure 3 display the GDP drops across all countries in our baseline model
following the labor supply shock. The four panels group countries into geographical regions. The
GDP reductions are dramatic, at

−29.6%

with GDP reductions ranging from

−11%

on average. There is a signicant amount of dispersion,
in Sweden and Taiwan to

−67%

The white parts of the bars denote the contribution of foreign shocks

Tn .

in Argentina and India.

It is evident that without

exception, foreign shocks transmitted through the global supply chains constitute a sizable minority
of the overall GDP contraction. The mean contribution of foreign shocks to the fall in GDP is

17

23.3%

of the total. Appendix Tables A5-A6 lists the GDP changes and the elements of the decomposition
underlying Figure 3 for every country in the sample.
Renationalization of the global supply chains

To answer whether participation in the global

supply chains makes economies more vulnerable to pandemic-related lockdowns, we must solve for
the GDP contraction under the same magnitude of a shock, but in a counterfactual economy in which
the supply chains have been renationalized. We construct the renationalization scenario as follows.
Starting from today's world economy, we increase iceberg trade costs to a very high value, and solve
for the new production equilibrium following the exact hat algebra approach of Dekle, Eaton, and
Kortum (2008). One subtlety with this exercise is that to nd the renationalized equilibrium we raise
the substitution elasticities above 1. This is because when elasticities are below 1, expenditure shares
on foreign goods increase in iceberg trade costs. Raising the substitution elasticities above 1 captures
the notion that supply chain renationalization will be a medium- to long-run adjustment, and thus
should be governed by higher substitution elasticities.

It also delivers the sensible outcome that

raising trade costs to very high levels eliminates cross-border trade.

13

We obtain virtually the same

results if we construct the renationalized equilibrium by simply reapportioning foreign spending
to domestic suppliers by at.

In Appendix B.4, we also show that the results of an alternative

renationalization scenario, where only intermediate iceberg trade costs are raised while leaving nal
good trade costs unchanged, are similar.
The gray bars in the top panel of Figure 3 plot counterfactual declines in GDP for the same shock in
a world where supply chains are domestic. It turns out that GDP declines would actually be larger
in this counterfactual world economy for a majority of countries. The mean decline in GDP in the
renationalized equilibrium is

−30.2% in our sample, slightly worse than the decline with international

supply chains. The renationalized equilibrium also features larger cross-country dispersion of GDP
changes. The standard deviation of GDP changes is 16% in the renationalized scenario compared
to 13% under trade (Table A7). Not surprisingly, participation in global supply chains synchronizes
GDP changes across countries.
To help understand this result, the bottom panel of Figure 3 implements the accounting decomposition (2.16). The blue bars are the dierence in GDP change in trade relative to autarky, the
left-hand side of (2.16). A positive value of the bar indicates that GDP falls by

less

in the current

trade equilibrium relative to the renationalization scenario, that is, global supply chains mitigate the
fall in GDP. The light gray bars are the transmission terms

Tn , which are all negative.

All else equal,

GDP falls by more in the trade equilibrium because foreign shocks can now also reduce domestic
GDP.

13

Our baseline calibration to elasticities below 1 is meant to reect that we are capturing the very short-run eects

of the pandemic lockdowns. Boehm, Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar (2020) provide a mutually consistent set of trade
elasticity estimates, and show that the elasticity is below 1 in the short run, but above 1 in the long run.

Dierence in GDP Change between Trade and Renationalized Equilibria
Notes:

The top panel of this gure displays the change in GDP following the labor supply shock described in

Section 3. The rst bar represents the change in GDP under trade, decomposed into domestic shock (dark blue) and
transmission (cream bar). The second bar represents the change in GDP under renationalization. Tables A5 and A6
in Appendix B.3 display the specic numbers. The bottom panel decomposes the change in the reaction of GDP to
T
the labor supply shock between the baseline trade economy (ln Vn ) and the renationalized supply chains economy
R
(ln Vn ), according to the decomposition in equation (2.16). The blue bar is the total dierence, the white bar is the
transmission, the red bar is the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the change in domestic PE.

19

The transmission terms paint an incomplete picture, however, because the inuence of domestic
sectors will also change. The white and dark gray bars plot the changes in the PE and GE components
of domestic inuence. The total change in domestic inuence (the sum of both stacked bars) is always
positive: in the trade equilibrium, most economies are

more

resilient to their own domestic shocks

than they would be in autarky. The change in the partial equilibrium term is negligible for most
countries, implying that most of the change in domestic inuence comes through general equilibrium
eects.
The net result of these opposing eects is that most countries would experience smaller GDP reductions in the current trade equilibrium than they would in a world of renationalized global supply
chains. Put plainly, eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance on the domestic inputs.
Since a pandemic-related lockdown also aects domestic sectors, on average there is no benet of
resilience from renationalizing the international supply chains.
There is variation across countries, however.

A number of important economies: Japan, Taiwan,

Sweden, and the US, among others, would be more resilient to the pandemic-related lockdown if their
supply chains were renationalized. The opposite is true of some Latin American (Peru, Argentina,
Colombia) and Asian (Philippines, India) countries.
To better understand this variation, the left panel of Figure 4 plots the combined general equilibrium
terms (domestic GE term and international transmission) against a country's lockdown stringency.
There is a tight positive relationship between the two, with a bivariate

R2

of close to

0.9.

Countries

with most stringent lockdowns are better o with international supply chains, and vice versa. This
is intuitive. A country with the most stringent lockdown is trading with countries with less severe
lockdowns. Thus, the reduction in the supply of foreign inputs is lower than the reduction in the
corresponding domestic inputs, since these are subject to a severe lockdown.
To highlight a source of remaining variation, the right panel of Figure 4 plots the change in domestic
PE against the change in the country-level exposure to the labor shock, dened as the Domarweighted sectoral exposure from Table A4. A country where participation in international supply
chains increases the size of sectors where work cannot be done from home becomes relatively less
resilient to domestic shocks in the trade equilibrium, and vice versa. As evident from the bottom
panel of Figure 3, the PE component is barely perceptible for most countries, and so a reshuing
of employment across sectors with dierent work-from-home intensities is not a large eect quantitatively.
Renationalizing supply chains in individual sectors

It may be that while renationalizing

all trade is not generally benecial, renationalizing specic sectors' supply chains can systematically
improve resilience. To check whether this is the case, we examine a set of counterfactuals in which we

Change in domestic PE

Notes: This gure presents scatterplots of the terms of the decomposition (2.16) against heuristic measures. The

right panel displays the change in domestic PE against the change in the country-level exposure, computed as the
Domar-weighted sum of sectoral exposure in from Table A4. The left panel displays the sum of the change in GE and

renationalize supply chains of each sector one at a time. That is, we force all inputs in one specic
sector to be sourced domestically.

We then subject this counterfactual economy to the lockdown

shock, and compare the GDP contraction to the baseline, as we did for the full renationalization
scenario.
The top panel of Figure 5 reports the results. For each sector, it presents a box plot of the dierence
in the GDP change in the baseline relative to the counterfactual in which that sector's inputs are
sourced domestically. A value of zero on the y-axis implies that there is no dierence in the lockdowndriven GDP change in this counterfactual relative to the baseline. The box depicts the interquartile
range of country-specic GDP change dierences, while whiskers extend to the adjacent values.
The outlier countries are labeled.
The main conclusion is that when it comes to GDP changes, renationalizing individual sectors has
a minimal impact. The mean dierence in GDP changes is a small fraction of a percent, and the
variation across countries is tight around zero. Even outliers almost never amount to a more than a
1.2% absolute dierence, relative to the GDP reductions of 29.6% on average.
It may be that while the resilience benets of renationalizing supply chains in a particular sector
are small for GDP, they are large for that particular sector.

The bottom panel of Figure 5 plots

instead the dierence in the value added change of that sector when its supply chain is renationalized

Dierence in Sector's VA Change
Notes: The top panel depicts the dierence in country-level GDP change due to the lockdown, between the baseline

scenario and a scenario where the individual sector's supply chain is renationalized. The bottom panel depicts the
dierence in the sector's real value added change due to the lockdown, between the baseline scenario and a scenario
where that sector's supply chain is renationalized.

and the baseline.

Once again, the averages cross countries as well as the interquartile ranges are

very close to zero. As expected, there are a few more visible outliers, but even for most outliers the

22

absolute dierence between the baseline and renationalization is small. Notably, the supply chain
renationalization in the Health sector beings the most visible benet on average, and the highest
dispersion in outcomes.

Nonetheless, while the values are large relative to other sector, they are

negligible in absolute terms. All in all, there appears to be no systematic benet of resilience to the
sector from renationalizing its supply chain.
Fit

While our calibration of the size of the shock used a log-normal transformation to approximate

the average fall in IP and its dispersion, we did not target the variation in output contractions across
countries in the sample. The left panel of Figure 6 plots the April 2020 IP contraction in the data
on the y-axis against the manufacturing output contraction implied by the model, along with the
45-degree line. The IP data are available for
of the country.

39 countries.

Circle sizes are proportional to total GDP

There is a clear positive correlation (0.56) between the data and the model.

We

do not target a perfect t. The lack of a perfect t is sensible, as the model is subjected to only
one, fairly parsimoniously specied exogenous shock, whereas the data are presumably generated by
many shocks. In addition, up-to-date IP data are available for only about two-thirds of the countries
in the sample.
The right panel of Figure 6 plots the February to May sectoral employment change in the US from
the Real-Time Population Survey (Bick, Blandin, and Mertens, 2020), against the model-implied
change in sectoral composite hours. Again, while we do not target the sectoral labor input changes
to calibrate our shock, the correlation is positive at

Cross sector employment t in the USA

Notes: This gure plots the change in April 2020 Industrial Production in the data against the fall in real man-

ufacturing output on the y-axis in the model for 39 countries (left panel), and changes in US sectoral hours in the
model against the change in US sectoral employment in the data (right panel). The lines through the data are the

and vary in an intuitive way with

The nal robustness exercise treats the Government

Response Index as a cardinal measure of lockdown stringency. The index, that varies from 0 to 1,
is treated as a percentage change in labor supply. The raw GRT index produces a similar average
contraction in GDP (30.2%), but undershoots substantially on the dispersion in GDP changes across
countries. The share of international transmission in the total GDP contraction, or the comparison
between autarky and trade are quite similar to the baseline.
Increased long-run demand for health services

Our next counterfactual simulates a pandemic

shock in a world with permanently increased demand for health services. To do this, we rst compute
a new pre-shock high-health steady state, in which the share of health expenditures in total nal
expenditures is twice as large as in the baseline. The mean share of health expenditures is 5% in our
sample of countries, and thus in the high-health scenario it increases to 10% for the average country.
We then simulate the same lockdown in this alternative economy.

The experiment is designed to

reect the fact that the Health sector becomes more important in the pandemic.
The blue bars in Figure 7 plot the dierence in GDP change in the high-health economy relative to
the baseline economy. A positive value indicates that the GDP downturn is less severe in the highhealth scenario. All the values are positive, which is sensible as the Health sector is not subject to

Notes: This gure displays the decomposition (2.16) of the GDP contraction dierence between the high-health
H
scenario (ln Vn ) and the baseline (ln Vn ). The blue bar is the total dierence, the white bar is the dierence in

transmission, the red bar is the dierence in the change in domestic GE, and the light green bar is the dierence in
the change in domestic PE.

the lockdown, and thus increasing the relative size of the health sector will lead to a smaller GDP
contraction. The dierence is small overall, ranging from 0.2% to 3% (whereas the GDP fall is on
the order of 29%).
The white, orange and light green bars in Figure 7 implement the PE/GE/International transmission
decomposition (2.16). The light green bar displays the dierence in domestic PE. In this experiment,
the domestic PE eect is the largest, accounting for the majority of the total GDP change.

The

dierence in GDP contraction in the high-health economy compared to the baseline is accounted
for by the fact that the high-health economy reallocates expenditure towards the sector not subject
to the negative labor supply shock. The domestic GE eect is in red. It ends up being positive, but
small. We conjecture that the relatively small domestic GE eect here is due to the fact that the
Health sector uses relatively few intermediate inputs, and thus its ability to stimulate demand for
upstream inputs is limited. The change in international transmission, in white, is small compared to
the domestic eects, and changes sign from country to country. This is consistent with the fact that
the health sector is relatively non-tradeable and uses few foreign inputs.
Reopening

Finally, we simulate the lifting of the lockdown restrictions. The model does not ex-

hibit asymmetries in the responses to positive vs. negative shocks. Thus, the GDP change following
a worldwide end to the lockdown is essentially the negative of the GDP changes reported in Figure

25

3. By the same token, the negative of the blue bars in the gure show what would happen if to an
individual country's GDP if it were the only one to reopen while the rest of the world stayed in lockdown. Since most of the GDP impact is due to the domestic lockdown policies, unilateral reopening
will achieve most of the GDP rebound even if other countries stay under lockdown. Similarly, the
negative of the white portions of the bars give GDP changes in the opposite scenario: the rest of the
world lifts restrictions while the country in question stays under lockdown. As long as the country
itself is under lockdown, the bounceback expected from foreign opening is comparatively modest.
To give the opening scenarios a bit more texture, and because the timing of lockdown removals is
likely to be staggered across countries, we simulate lifting the lockdowns country-by-country. The
top panel of Figure 8 plots the change in the rest of the world's GDP when the country on the x-axis
lifts its lockdown. Not surprisingly, opening of the largest economies  US, China, Russia, Germany,
Japan  would have the greatest impact on others. By contrast, since most countries are small, their
opening will have a negligible impact on the rest of the world. The middle and bottom panels of
Figure 8 display the GDP change in the country on the x-axis following the end of the lockdowns in
the US and China, respectively. These countries' opening can raise GDP in some of the most tightly
linked countries by up to 1-2.5% in some cases.
Appendix Figure A2 plots the entire matrix of other countries' GDP changes.

The axis labeled

Source refers to the country whose reopening is being simulated. The axis labeled Destination
refers to the country whose GDP change is being plotted. Thus, the gure plots the GDP change
in Destination following the lifting of a lockdown in Source. Countries on both axes are sorted
in descending order of impact. Thus, countries in the left end of the Source axis are those whose
opening has the largest impact on other countries in the world. Finally, we suppress the own country
impact, as those values would swamp the variation in the plots (this explains the scattered blanks
in the picture).

5 Conclusion
Global supply chains are a central feature of the world economy. As most countries go into lockdowns,
there are concerns about both the present and the future. In the present, global supply chains are
widely believed to transmit the crisis across countries. The future is forecasted to bring about at
least some renationalization of the supply chains.
This paper performs a quantitative assessment of the role of global supply chains in the pandemic.
While foreign lockdowns undoubtedly contribute to the size of economic downturns experienced by
countries, the majority of GDP contractions come from the domestic lockdown policies.

By and

large, severing global supply chains will not make countries more resilient to pandemic-style labor
supply shocks. This is because reducing the importance of foreign inputs mechanically increases the

26

importance of domestic inputs. If domestic inputs are also subject to lockdowns, renationalization
doesn't help mitigate the size of the contraction.

Renationalization will make the economy more

resilient if the country plans to have a less stringent lockdown then its trading partners, and vice
versa.

Appendix A Inuence vector
Proof of Proposition 1:

The derivation of the inuence vector follows closely the steps in Huo, Levchenko,

and Pandalai-Nayar (2020). In this appendix, we derive the inuence matrix under the assumption that there is
only one group for the nal good consumption. The more general case with multiple groups is a straightforward
extension of the current analysis.

Average

Notes: The rst column reports the share of the labor input that can be provided from home, by sector. The sectoral

measure is computed as an average of Dingel and Neiman (2020)'s work from home intensity at the occupational
level, weighted using sectoral level expenditure shares on each occupation. The second column reports the sectoral
exposure, dened as the share of total output accounted for by labor that cannot be done from home,

Curving of the stringency index

We obtained Industrial Production (IP) data up to April 2020 for 39 of our 64 countries from the OECD,
Eurostat, and some national statistical agencies (for Argentina, India, Taiwan, and Australia). The April 2020
IP contraction is dened as the log dierence with respect to the maximum 3-month moving average in the
previous 12 months (meant to capture contraction relative to the peak). In practice, we drop the countries
with the three biggest and smallest falls to avoid extreme values in the lognormal t. To curve the Government
Response Index (GRI), we use the inverse CDF of a lognormal distribution with parameters

µ

and

σ,

and

attribute a stringency to each country equal to the quantile corresponding to its empirical GRI CDF. We then
solve for the change in manufacturing output using the resulting labor supply shock, and target the average
change in IP across countries, and the range between the maximal and minimal change. The curving results
in a lognormal t with parameters
unchanged at

B.3

0.805

instead of

0.806,

µ = −0.302

and

σ = 0.531.

It leaves the average stringency virtually

but increases the dispersion.

Fit of the linear approximation

Figure A3 assesses the t of the linear approximation used in the main

results by plotting the baseline changes in GDP against changes in GDP computed using exact hat algebra
following Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2008)'s procedure. The dots all lie close to the 45 degree line, implying
that the linear approximation is a good t.

Sensitivity

This section presents the main results of the paper with dierent elasticities. Table A7 sum-

marizes the average declines in GDP in the baseline and under alternative elasticities. Figure A5 shows the
changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized scenario, when the elasticity of substitution in consumption between manufacture, service, and health groups (ρ) is equal to

1.

Figure A6 shows

the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized scenario, when the intermediate
inputs elasticity (ε) is equal to

1.

Figure A7 shows the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline

and renationalized scenario, when the elasticity of substitution in production across occupations (κ) is equal
to

0.2.

Figure A8 (A9) shows the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized

scenario, when the Frisch elasticity of labor supply (ψ ) is set to 1 (0.2). Figure A10 shows the changes in real
GDP and dierence between baseline and renationalized scenario, when the within-group Armington elasticity
(γ ) is equal to

0.5.

Finally, Figure A11 shows the changes in real GDP and dierence between baseline and

renationalized scenario, when the shock is calibrated using the raw stringency index without rescaling.
Overall, the numbers are very close to the baseline, except when the Frisch elasticity is lowered. In that case,
the drop in GDP and transmission are lower, as hours don't react as much. When the stringency index is not
rescaled to match the standard deviation in the data. In that case, the average GDP drop remains similar,
