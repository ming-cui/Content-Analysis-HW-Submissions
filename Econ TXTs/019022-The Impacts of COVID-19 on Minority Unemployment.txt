The Impacts of COVID-19 on Minority Unemployment: First Evidence from April 2020 CPS
Microdata

ABSTRACT
COVID-19 abruptly impacted the labor market with the unemployment rate jumping to 14.7
percent less than two months after state governments began adopting social distancing measures.
Unemployment of this magnitude has not been seen since the Great Depression. This paper
provides the first study of how the pandemic impacted minority unemployment using CPS
microdata through April 2020. African-Americans experienced an increase in unemployment to
16.6 percent, less than anticipated based on previous recessions. In contrast, Latinx, with an
unemployment rate of 18.2 percent, were disproportionately hard hit by COVID-19. Adjusting for
concerns of the BLS regarding misclassification of unemployment, we create an upper-bound
measure of the national unemployment rate of 26.5 percent, which is higher than the peak
observed in the Great Depression. The April 2020 upper-bound unemployment rates are an
alarming 31.8 percent for blacks and 31.4 percent for Latinx. Difference-in-difference estimates
suggest that blacks were, at most, only slightly disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Nonlinear decomposition estimates indicate that a slightly favorable industry distribution partly
protected them from being hit harder by COVID-19. The most impacted group are Latinx.
Difference-in-difference estimates unequivocally indicate that Latinx were disproportionately
impacted by COVID-19. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to
why Latinx experienced much higher unemployment rates than whites. These findings of early
impacts of COVID-19 on unemployment raise important concerns about long-term economic
effects for minorities.

1. Introduction
The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the entire world. To slow the spread of
the contagious disease governments have enforced stringent social distancing (i.e. “shelter-inplace” and “stay-at-home”) restrictions that have mostly shut down businesses and laid off
workers in jobs and industries deemed non-essential and severely reduced demand for other
businesses. The effects on the economy are readily observed through a tumultuous stock
market, surge in unemployment insurance claims, and shuttering of many store fronts across
the country. What is less well known, however, is whether these effects are being felt
differently across the population, especially among economically disadvantaged groups such as
African-Americans and Latinx. Because of limited savings and wealth these groups are especially
vulnerable to negative economic shocks such as layoffs from COVID-19 (Canilang et al. 2020).
The unemployment rate among blacks in the United States has been roughly double
that of whites for several decades. For example, over the past four decades, the average rate of
unemployment was 11.7 percent for blacks versus 5.4 percent for whites. Historical analyses
over the past century and a half indicate that the 2:1 ratio of black-to-white unemployment
rates first emerged in the 1950s (Fairlie and Sundstrom 1997, 1999). In his classic study of black
unemployment, Freeman (1973) finds that black employment is more volatile than white
employment and that the unemployment rate for blacks rises more than that for whites when
the economy weakens (concluding that it supports “the widely asserted last in, first out pattern
of black employment over the cycle”). Refining the analysis to focus on unemployment
transitions, blacks are found to be the first “fired” as the business cycle weakens, but not
necessarily the last hired (Couch and Fairlie 2010). They are also more likely to transit out of the

1

labor force when leaving employment than whites. The Great Recession is found to also
negatively impact minority unemployment, and recent research shows that Latinx also have
higher unemployment rates and cyclical sensitivity than whites (e.g. Couch, Fairlie and Xu 2018;
Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller 2012; Orrenius and Zavodny 2010). 1
In this paper, we explore how COVID-19 affected minority unemployment. We explore
two main questions. First, we examine whether COVID-19 disproportionately impacted AfricanAmericans and Latinx relative to whites. In light of the well documented “first fired” pattern
and persistently higher unemployment among blacks, we might expect to see unemployment
rise by twice as much for blacks as for whites, and Latinx unemployment to lie between those
groups. But, COVID-19 is different than previous recessions due to health-related mandated
business closures and might result in different new disproportionate impacts by race, for which
even the direction is theoretically unknown. Second, we explore more generally how COVID-19
has differentially affected unemployment across job and skill types that in turn have
ramifications for racial disparities in unemployment. Did the industries, occupations and skill
levels of white workers insulate them from job losses due to shelter-in-place restrictions
relative to minorities? Or, were minorities more likely to be in essential jobs and industries?
To test these hypotheses, we provide the first analysis of Current Population Survey
(CPS) microdata from April 2020 – the first month fully capturing the immediate impacts of
COVID-19. We compare impacts on black and Latinx unemployment in April 2020 relative to
February 2020, longer trends in unemployment, and the Great Recession. Our analysis reveals
that even though the black unemployment rate skyrocketed to 16.6 percent, blacks were not

1

The average Latinx unemployment rate over the past four decades (1980-2019) was 8.6 percent.

2

disproportionately impacted relative to whites by COVID-19 in April 2020 compared to previous
months using the official measure of unemployment. The black-white unemployment rate gap
increased by 0.4 percentage points in April from February 2020 but actually declined in
comparison to the experience of the Great Recession. Difference-in-difference estimates
indicate either a null or slightly negative (i.e. lower) disproportionate impact on unemployment
for blacks from COVID-19. Turning to an upper-bound measure of unemployment based on BLS
concerns about misclassifications of workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020), we find a black
unemployment rate that shot up to 31.8 percent, 8.3 percentage points higher than for whites.
Difference-in-difference estimates provide some evidence of a small disproportionate impact
on the black-white gap in unemployment from COVID-19.
The impacts on Latinx are less ambiguous. The unemployment rate among Latinx
increased in April 2020 to 18.2 percent, or 31.4 percent, using the upper-bound measure of
unemployment. Either rate is considerably higher than for whites. Difference-in-difference
estimates provide consistent evidence across all time periods and measures used of
disproportionate increases in Latinx unemployment relative to whites due to COVID-19.
To test the second hypothesis, we estimate non-linear decompositions to identify the
job-, skill- and geography-related factors that placed minorities at more or less of a risk of losing
jobs due to COVID-19. There are three main findings from the analysis. First, we find that blacks
had a somewhat favorable industry distribution that partially protected them from becoming
unemployed in April 2020 relative to whites. Second, we find that a less favorable occupational
distribution and lower skills contributed to why Latinx experienced much higher unemployment

3

rates than whites. Finally, we find that occupational and educational differences contribute to
why blacks have higher unemployment rates in the early stages of the pandemic.
The findings from our paper contribute to a small emerging literature on the early-stage
COVID-19 impacts on the labor market. Kahn, Lange and Wiczer (2020) make use of job posting
data from Burning Glass along with data on initial Unemployment Insurance claims to analyze
the decline in labor demand and concentrations of job loss. They find that job postings declined
by 30 percent and that with the exception of employment in essential industries that all states
and sectors experienced sharp increases in unemployment. Using payroll data Cajner et al.
(2020) find that private sector payrolls shrank by 22 percent in the two-month span from midMarch to mid-April. Montenovo et al. (2020) use CPS data from March 2020 to construct
indices of job characteristics to explore differences in factors expected to be related to job loss
such as the ability to work remotely and the importance of face-to-face contact across a wide
range of groups. They find that these factors help explain differences in emerging
unemployment rates across groups in addition to the general occupational distribution. Our
paper builds on the results of these previous studies by providing the first detailed analysis of
unemployment among minorities driven by the spread of the coronavirus in the United States
and the first study of the early effects of COVID-19 on unemployment using April 2020 CPS
data.

2. Context and Data
COVID-19

4

The first diagnosed case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States was reported
on January 20, 2020 in the state of Washington (Holshue et al. 2020). Subsequent cases were
reported in Illinois by January 24th and California and Arizona by January 26th (Lardieri 2020). By
March 17th, all states in the U.S. had reported cases (NPR, March 17, 2020). As the disease
spread, social distancing measures were quickly adopted, first in localities and settings such as
education but on a statewide basis beginning in California on March 19th. By March 23rd, all
states had adopted some social distancing measures which in many states included closures of
non-essential businesses (Adolph et al. 2020). These policy reactions as well as those of
individuals as business owners, employees and customers to the rapidly spreading virus raised
concerns about sharp increases in unemployment.

Current Population Survey (CPS)
The data used in the analysis are the Basic Monthly Files from the Current Population
Survey (CPS), the source of the official household-based survey measure of unemployment
tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These surveys, conducted monthly by the U.S.
Bureau of the Census and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, are representative of the entire
U.S. population and contain observations for more than 130,000 people.
Released on the Friday of the first or second full week of each month, the survey is
typically collected in a reference week containing the 12th day of the prior month. The March
CPS survey, for example, reflected events as they had evolved through March 14th, the end of
the survey period for March data. The survey results showed that the unemployment rate in
March rose to 4.4 percent reflecting an increase of 1.4 million additional unemployed

5

Americans from February 2020 (BLS April 2020, Table A). However, it is well understood that
the March data did not reflect many of the individual and policy responses to the spread of the
virus and resulting unemployment.
The April CPS data was collected the week of the 12th through 18th of the month of April.
In contrast to the March data, the April data are collected after all states had implemented
social distancing measures due to COVID-19. Thus, our analysis of the impact of the
coronavirus on the U.S. labor market using the April 2020 CPS data will begin to more fully
capture the impact of the pandemic on the labor market relative to analyses of the March data.
When the BLS released the April data (BLS May 2020), concerns were raised regarding
individuals who were not working but who were being paid that should have been coded as
unemployed but were instead counted as employed. Additionally, a large fraction of those who
lost work indicated that they wanted a job but were not actively looking for work and were
coded as out of the labor force rather than unemployed. In our analyses, we provide alternate
unemployment calculations adding these people to the count of the unemployed as their work
was impacted by the pandemic. This is one way of incorporating minorities who have a greater
tendency to leave the labor force when a job is lost into the analysis.

Method for Classifying Essential and Non-Essential Industries
As cases of COVID-19 were found in the U.S. individual states mandated closure of nonessential businesses while allowing essential businesses to remain open. We use Delaware’s
essential business criteria to determine whether an industry is essential in the CPS data at the

6

4-digit industry level. 2 The Delaware State list is the most comprehensive and detailed set of
codes that we could find. It also follows the same 4-digit industry codes as the CPS (North
American Industry Classification System, NAICS). The only modification we made is that we
noticed that a few industries are classified as non-essential but are actually being run remotely
(e.g. all education). We thus define these industries as essential. Using this measure, we find
that 84 percent of the workforce is in essential 4-digit industries. 3 The classification is likely to
be imperfect, however, because definitions, enforcement, business owner compliance and
consumer reactions vary across the country.

3. Disparities in Unemployment
Unemployment Rate by Race in the Pandemic
Table 1 reports estimates of unemployment rates by race for April 2020 and other time
periods for comparison (also see Figures 2-5). The unemployment rate was alarmingly high in
April 2020. The U.S. unemployment rate hit 14.5 percent which was the highest level since the
Great Depression and roughly 5 percentage points (or 50 percent) higher than the peak during
the Great Recession. All racial groups experienced massive increases in unemployment in April
2020. The unemployment rate hit 16.6 percent for African-Americans and 12.8 percent for
whites (which we measure as white non-Hispanic throughout). The highest level was for Latinx
at 18.2 percent. Asians experienced an unemployment rate of 13.7 percent.

2

The Delaware’s full list can be accessed at the reference link “List of Delaware Business Categories that are
Essential and Non-Essential (March 22, 2020)”, https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/resources-for-businesses/.
3
In the analyses below, we also use a definition that aggregates industries to the 2-digit level (52 categories) and
defines an industry to be essential if at least 50% of more detailed industries are essential. Using this categorizations
we find that 62 percent of the workforce are in essential industries. Findings are similar using this alternative 2-digit
definition.

As shown in Table 1, the comparison to February 2020, the last month before statewide
social distancing measures were put in place, is striking. The unemployment rate was at or near
long-term lows of 6.4 percent for blacks and 4.7 percent for Latinx. Whites had an
unemployment rate of 3.1 percent and Asians 2.6 percent. Over the two-month time period
subsequently impacted by the coronavirus, the unemployment rate increased by 9.7
percentage points for whites. For blacks, unemployment rates increased by slightly more (10.2
percentage points). This contrasts sharply with previous recessions in which black
unemployment rates tended to increase by much more in percentage points because of a
constant proportional change relative to whites (i.e. usually maintaining the oft-noted 2:1
ratio).
The unemployment rate increased by 13.5 percentage points for Latinx which was the
largest increase for any group. Asians also experienced a relatively large increase in
unemployment (11.1 percentage points) from one month prior to social distancing restrictions
and one month into those restrictions. Comparisons to January 2020 reveal similar sharp
increases in unemployment rates. Interestingly, from January to April 2020, the increase in
black unemployment rates was 9.8 percentage points, almost identical to the increase for
whites of 9.7 percentage points.
Unemployment rates measured in March of 2020 began to reveal changes from earlier
months, but were only a fraction of the size of increases observed in April 2020. Restrictions in
most localities across the United States were put in place after mid-month following data
collection for the March survey. The BLS (April 2020) notes “the March survey reference
periods for both surveys predated many coronavirus-related business and school closures in the

8

second half of the month.” Thus, we focus on comparisons between April 2020, February 2020
and other time periods.
Using the period from January 2017 to December 2019, we find that black
unemployment at 6.8 percent was 3.5 percentage points higher than for whites (again
displaying the roughly 2:1 ratio). Latinx unemployment was 4.6 percent which was 1.4
percentage points higher than white rates.
Comparing what is happening due to COVID-19 and the previous recession is illustrative.
In the Great Recession, black unemployment rates were 11.4 percent which was 5.8 percentage
points higher than white rates. Latinx unemployment rates were 8.7 percent (3.1 percentage
points higher than white rates). In previous work, we find that the disproportionate increase in
unemployment among blacks and Latinx was due to increased job loss, which is consistent with
widely asserted “first fired” patterns (Couch and Fairlie 2000; Couch, Fairlie and Xu 2018). The
2:1 ratio holds roughly over the business cycle for blacks resulting in much larger racial gaps in
unemployment rates measured in percentage points.
Figure 1 displays unemployment rates by race from January 2001 to April 2020. The
patterns over time are clear. Black and Latinx unemployment rates follow white unemployment
rates rising and falling cyclically, and the gap becomes larger in downturns and smaller in
growth periods. The gaps between black and white unemployment historically are larger than
for Latinx versus the whites.
In Figure 1, the COVID-19 recession starting in April 2020 resulted in an anomalous,
striking jump in unemployment rates for all groups. Extremely rapid job loss of this scale is

9

unprecedented. The pattern is also anomalous because the unemployment rate for the Latinx
group in April (18.2 percent) exceeded that of blacks (16.6 percent) for the first time.

The Disproportionate Impacts of COVID-19 on Minorities
The comparison of racial differences in unemployment rates (i.e. gaps) in April 2020 to
previous time periods creates a simple and straightforward difference-in-difference estimate of
the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on minority unemployment rates. The black-white
gap in April 2020 shown in Table 1 is 3.8 percentage points. This is only slightly larger than the
gaps of 3.4 percentage points in February 2020, 3.7 percentage points in January, and 3.5
percentage points from 2017-2019. The difference then between the black-white
unemployment gap in April versus these prior months and years is small. Looking back further
to the most recent recession for comparison, the black-white gap in the Great Recession was
much higher at 5.8 percentage points. Blacks experienced a smaller negative impact on their
employment relative to whites due to COVID-19 when compared to what happened in the
Great Recession and the small relative impact in prior months. This is an important break from
prior cyclical behavior of unemployment rates.
In sharp contrast to these patterns, Latinx experienced a much worse impact on
unemployment in April 2020 as seen in Table 1. The Latinx-white unemployment gap in the
three year span from 2017-2019 was 1.4 percentage points. The gap in the months of January
and February of 2020 were 2.0 and 1.7 percentage points respectively. The gap soared to 5.4
percentage points in April 2020. The COVID-19 Latinx-white gap is already higher than it was
during the Great Recession (3.1 percentage points). Latinos clearly experienced a

10

disproportionately large impact from COVID-19 in comparison to recent months or the Great
Recession.

Newly Unemployed
Table 1 also reports estimates of unemployment rates for those newly unemployed at
the time of the April 2020 CPS survey. We create a definition of unemployment that only
captures individuals who were unemployed within the past two months. For the mid-April
survey this moves the start date of the unemployment spell back to mid-February, prior to
shelter-in-place restrictions and the February 2020 survey. It captures those who lost jobs as
the coronavirus spread. This newly unemployed rate for blacks is 14.3 percent which is 2.8
percentage points higher than for whites. 4 The Latinx newly unemployed rate is 16.3
percentage points which is 4.8 percentage points higher than for whites. The racial gaps for
blacks and Latinx are somewhat lower when focusing on this measure, but remain very high for
Latinx.

Adding Discouraged Workers and Absent Workers
The BLS released warnings about the March and April 2020 counts of unemployment
indicating they may possibly be too low. In the reports (BLS April 2020, p. 4) they note that
“workers who indicate that they were not working during the entire reference week due to
efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus should be classified as unemployed on

4

The newly unemployment rate excludes the longer-term unemployed (i.e. more than 2 months) from the sample.
This group represents 16 percent of the April 2020 unemployed for blacks and 12 percent for whites.

11

temporary layoff, whether or not they are paid for the time they were off work.” But, when BLS
made careful comparisons to previous months and years, they found that many of these
workers were classified (ibid) as “employed but absent from work.” BLS’s goal was that these
workers should have been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. Appropriateness of
inclusion of these workers in unemployment, however, is not entirely unambiguous. If a worker
is on temporary work restriction, but getting paid by their employer does that fit the definition
of unemployment?
Another concern noted by the BLS in the April 2020 Report was that the number of
people not in the labor force reporting that they currently want a job nearly doubled in April.
Unemployment is defined by not having a job and “actively looking for and available for work.”
But, in the current pandemic there is the concern that some individuals were classified as not in
the labor force (NILF) even though they wanted a job. The BLS notes that the large increase in
the NILF want a job category “reflects the impact of the pandemic on the job market.” The
problem is that because of the pandemic many people who wanted a job in April had not
looked for work recently. BLS notes that if these individuals “had actively looked for work in the
prior 4 weeks and were available to take a job, they would have been counted among the
unemployed.” This group could also be added to the unemployment numbers to gauge the
impact of the coronavirus on nonemployment.
To gauge the potential importance of these concerns, we create a second measure of
unemployment at the individual level to incorporate these two groups noted by the BLS as
representing labor market impacts of the pandemic. This “upper-bound” measure of
unemployment adds both the group that reported being employed but absent from work and

12

those NILF who wanted a job. We add those who were NILF back to the labor force (i.e.
denominator) to recalculate the unemployment rates for different periods and groups.
Table 2 reports these alternate estimates of unemployment. In February 2020, the
official unemployment rate was 3.8 percent and the alternate upper-bound unemployment rate
was 9.1 percent. In April 2020, however, the national unemployment rate was 14.5 percent and
the upper-bound (UB) unemployment rate was 26.5 percent. One view of this alternate
measure, which more broadly reflects labor market impacts of COVID-19, is that unemployment
is already exceeding the peak seen in the Great Depression.
For this alternate upper-bound measure we find that blacks had an unemployment rate
of 31.8 percent, 8.3 percentage points higher than the white rate. This black-white gap is larger
than it was in February 2020 (5.0 percent), January 2020 (5.3 percent), or in the three years
from 2017-2019 (4.6 percent) suggesting that blacks experienced a disproportionate impact
from COVID-19 (relative to whites) of about 3 percentage points using the expanded measure
of unemployment relative to recent months. In the Great Recession the upper-bound
unemployment rate was 7.2 percentage points higher for blacks than whites. While the current
gap in unemployment between blacks and whites is similar to that observed in the Great
Recession using this alternate measure of unemployment, it is important to bear in mind that
the current increase in unemployment has occurred in two months. The larger gap under this
alternative measure also points to the tendency of blacks to exit the labor force when
unemployment is experienced and this pattern appears to remain in place in this pandemic
induced recession.

13

For the Latinx group, the upper-bound measure indicates an unemployment rate of 31.4
percent in April of 2020 which is 7.9 percentage points higher than for whites. This large
differential also contrasts with much smaller gaps in February (1.4 percentage points), January
(2.1 percentage points), or the previous three year time period (1.2 percentage points). Thus,
the gap widened by 5 to 6 percentage points in comparison to recent months. It also contrasts
with a smaller gap in the Great Recession of 2.6 percentage points. Latinx experienced an
unambiguously large disproportionate impact from COVID on unemployment.

Difference-in-Difference Regressions Showing COVID-19 Impacts
To more formally test whether COVID-19 had disproportionate impacts on
unemployment among minorities, we turn to a regression analysis. The following regression
equation for the probability of unemployment is estimated:
(3.1) Uit = α + γ1Blacki + γ2Latinxi + γ3Asiani + πCOVIDt + δ1Black*COVIDt + δ2Latinx*COVIDt +
δ3Asian*COVIDt + β'Xit + λt + θt + εit,
where Uit equals 1 if the individual is unemployed in the survey month and 0 otherwise, COVIDt
is a dummy variable for April 2020, Xit includes individual, regional and job characteristics, λt are
month (i.e. January, … , December) fixed effects to control for seasonal variation in
unemployment, θt are year fixed effects and/or time trends, and εit is the error term. March
2020 is excluded from the sample to avoid complications associated with a partially COVID-19
impacted month. The parameters of interest are δ1, δ2 and δ3. They capture the difference-indifference or disproportionate effect estimates of the coronavirus on minority unemployment.

14

All specifications are estimated with OLS using CPS sample weights and robust standard errors.
Marginal effects estimates are similar from probit and logit models, and are thus not reported.
Table 3 reports estimates of (3.1) that vary the sample time period and time controls.
Specification 1 includes only February and April 2020 data. Specification 2 uses data from
January 2017 to April 2020, omitting March 2020. Specification 3 similarly spans December
2007 to April 2020, omitting March 2020. Columns (1) though (3) make use of the official
unemployment measure while Columns (4) through (6) use the expanded upper-bound
measure of unemployment. The regressions also hold constant group differences in individual,
job and geographic characteristics as they are available for different samples.
The results in Specification 1 based on the official measure of unemployment show that
COVID-19 resulted in a 10.1 percentage point increase that is highly statistically significant. For
blacks, the impact of COVID did not meaningfully widen the unemployment gap in April
compared to February. In contrast, Latinx experienced a large and statistically significant
increase in unemployment relative to whites of 3.7 percentage points. Asians experienced a
smaller increase in unemployment of 1.5 percentage points due to COVID-19 (which is
significant at the 0.10 level). Specification 2 extends the sample period back to January 2007,
and adds a time trend and month of year dummies (to control for seasonality). The estimates
are similar.
Specification 3 extends the sample period back to the start of the Great Recession –
starting in December 2007. The Great Recession also becomes the reference time period in this
regression. We now find a negative COVID estimate of -0.014 for blacks which suggests that the
black-white gap in unemployment was smaller than thus far due to COVID-19 than during the

15

Great Recession even after controlling for numerous other factors. For Latinx, the change in
reference time period continues to reveal a disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on their
unemployment. Asians experience a smaller widening between their rate of unemployment
and that of whites.
Given the much higher levels of unemployment when we add the individuals that the
BLS cautions may have been misclassified, we also estimate the difference-in-difference models
using this upper-bound unemployment measure in Specifications 4-6. We note, however, that
we cannot include occupation and industry controls for all observations because they are not
collected for more than 90 percent of those out of the labor force. The impact of COVID-19 for
all groups in column (4) using only February and April data is a 13.9 percentage point increase
in unemployment. Although these levels are higher, changes over time for the gap in blackwhite unemployment due to COVID-19 are estimated to be 1.5 percentage points (p < .10). A
similar estimate is found in Specification 5 when the sample is expanded back to 2017 (now
with p<.05). A statistically significant estimate is not found for changes due to COVID when the
data are extended back to the Great Recession. 5
Using the alternate definition of employment for Latinx, the estimated increase in the
unemployment gap due to COVID-19 ranges from 4.7 to 5.5 percentage points depending on
the sample used in Specifications 4-6. Similarly, the change in the gap due to COVID-19 ranges
from 3.0 to 4.4 percentage points for Asians. Thus, using either definition of unemployment,
Latinx have been most impacted by COVID-19 followed closely by Asians. The change in the

5

For this specification, because of data availability in creating the upper-bound measure of unemployment the
sample is limited to December 2007 through June of 2009 and January 2017 through April 2020 excluding March
2020.

16

unemployment gap for blacks due to COVID-19 as the economy has worsened has been muted
in comparison to prior downturns.

4. Job and Skill-Level Risk Factors for COVID-19 Impacts
To investigate whether various job, skill and region characteristics place minorities at
differential risk of unemployment in general and during COVID-19, we examine distributions in
these characteristics by race and then perform decompositions that identify which factors are
the most important. Table 4 presents racial differences in risk factors for unemployment such
as education, potential work experience, industry, occupation and geographical region
calculated over the 3 years prior to the implementation of social distancing measures (February
2017 through February 2020) as well as the national unemployment rate for that classification
in April 2020. There are major differences in characteristics across racial groups. Considering
educational categories, the largest unemployment rates in April are among those with less than
a high school (LTHS) education (23.8 percent) and high school graduates (18.7 percent). 23.7
percent of Latinx workers have LTHS education, more than 4 times any other group. Further,
more than 30 percent of blacks and Latinx have a high school degree as their highest level of
education. Those with graduate degrees have the lowest rates of unemployment in April 2020
(6.3 percent): blacks and Latinx have the lowest proportions in this group. Thus, Latinx are
concentrated among educational categories consistent with lower skills and a higher likelihood
of unemployment and to a lesser extent this is true for blacks.
Another major difference across racial and ethnic groups is their geographical
concentrations across the country. The majority of blacks (57.2 percent) live in the South

17

whereas the South captures no more than 39 percent of the population for any other group.
Nearly half of all Asians live in the West, and 40 percent of Latinx live in the West. The Midwest
captures 27 percent of the white population, which is the highest of all groups. Average
unemployment in the South is about 2.5 percentage points lower in other regions and this may
be advantageous for blacks in retaining employment.
In terms of potential work experience (age – year of school leaving), observed
distributions across groups are consistent with national demographic patterns. Relatively
recent entrants to the labor market with 20 or fewer years of potential labor market experience
are more likely to be non-white (Latinx, black, Asian). This lack of relative skills accumulated
through job experience serves as a disadvantage to these minority groups because
unemployment rates in April of 2020 are particularly concentrated among those with low levels
of experience.
A factor that might be expected to influence group unemployment is the distribution of
workers across essential and non-essential industries. Table 4 shows that although
unemployment is concentrated among workers in non-essential industries (30 percent) that
there is little variation in the proportion employed in those industries across groups. The range
across blacks, Latinx, Asians and whites in non-essential industries is only from 15.2 to 16.5
percent.
Across major industry groups, the highest unemployment rates occurred in Leisure and
Hospitality (38 percent) where Latinx have the largest prior concentration of employment (12.4
percent) of any group although blacks and Asians also have higher proportions than whites
employed in this industry. Similarly, rates of unemployment are high in Wholesale and Retail

18

Trade (16.7 percent) and Construction (15.6 percent) and Latinx have the highest proportion of
any group employed in those industries. In areas like Educational and Health Services which
has a relatively low rate of unemployment (11.3 percent), blacks and whites have the largest
shares of their workers employed, 27.1 and 23.1 percent respectively.
Across occupations, the highest observed unemployment rate is for Service Occupations
(27.3 percent). Blacks and Hispanics have the highest proportions (24.3 and 24.1 percent
respectively) employed in Service occupations which is predictive of a greater chance of job
loss. Construction and Extraction Occupations also have a high unemployment rate of 19.1
percent in April. Again, Latinx have the largest concentration of their workers (11.4 percent) in
this industry. The two categories with the lowest rates of unemployment are Management,
Business and Financial Occupations (6.2 percent) and Professional and Related Occupations (8.8
percent). 44.9 percent of whites are employed in these two occupations and but only 22.1
percent of Latinx and 30.3 percent of Blacks. The concentration of Latinx and to a lesser extent
blacks in high unemployment occupations and their relative under representation in low
unemployment occupations suggests that in comparison, the occupational distribution is not
favorable to their employment in the current recession.
Overall, there exist major differences in education, geography and job characteristics
across racial and ethnic groups. These patterns, especially across occupations and industries,
are likely to contribute to differences in unemployment rates, but it is difficult to assess how
important these differences are to the racial gaps in unemployment rates. The decompositions
presented in the next section shed direct light on this question.

19

Decomposition Technique
The comparison of average skill, job and geographic characteristics across racial groups
identifies several potential risk factors for high levels of minority unemployment. The
comparison, however, does not specify how much each risk factor contributes directly to
unemployment rate disparities. To explore this question we perform a decomposition
technique that allows one to estimate the separate contributions from differences between
groups in education, industry and other characteristics to the racial gaps in unemployment
rates.
Specifically, we "decompose" inter-group differences in a dependent variable into those
due to different observable characteristics across groups (sometime referred to as the
endowment effect) and those due to different ”prices” of characteristics of groups (see Blinder
1973 and Oaxaca 1973). The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition of the white/minority gap in the
average value of the dependent variable, Y, can be expressed as:

[

] [

]

(1) Y W - Y M = ( X W - X M ) βˆ W + X M ( βˆ W - βˆ M ) .

Similar to most recent studies applying the decomposition technique, we focus on
estimating the first component of the decomposition that captures contributions from
differences in observable characteristics or “endowments.” We do not report estimates for
the second or ”unexplained” component of the decomposition because it partly captures
contributions from group differences in unmeasurable characteristics and is sensitive to the
choice of left-out categories making the results difficult to interpret.

20

We also weight the first term of the decomposition expression using coefficient
estimates from a pooled sample of all groups (see Oaxaca and Ransom 1994 for example). It is
becoming increasingly popular to use the full sample of all races to estimate the coefficients
instead of one group such as whites because it incorporates the full market response and does
not exclude rapidly growing groups of the population such as Latinx and Asians (see Fairlie 2017
for more details). 6 It is also advantageous in situations with multiple group comparisons
because it creates a common base.
The contribution from ethnic/racial differences in the characteristics can thus be written
as:
(2) ( X W - X B ) βö* .
Where X j are means of firm characteristics of race j, βö* is a vector of pooled coefficient
estimates, and j=W or M for white or minority, respectively. Equation (2) provides an estimate
of the contribution of ethnic/racial differences in the entire set of independent variables to the
racial gap. Separate calculations are made to identify the contribution of group differences in
specific variables to the gap. 7
The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition represented in equation (2) is used to identify the
causes of differences in unemployment, but with an adjustment for the binary unemployment
variable. We use a popular alternative non-linear decomposition technique (Fairlie 1999, 2017;
Jann 2006).

6

Dummy variables for each racial group are also included in the underlying regression.
In the Blinder-Oaxaca technique the contribution estimates are insensitive to the choice of the left-out category.
For example, the percent explained by education would be the same if the lowest education category is the left-out
category in the underlying regressions or if the highest education category is the left-out category in the underlying
regressions.

Decomposition Results
Table 5 reports estimates from the non-linear procedure for decomposing gaps in
unemployment between whites and blacks, Latinx and Asians separately. Specification 1 reports
estimates for the factors contributing to the difference in unemployment rates between blacks
and whites (3.8 percentage points). The decomposition reveals that having lower skills as
measured by education contributes 0.5 percentage points to the unemployment gap. The
largest factor contributing to the gap is the related occupational distribution which adds 1.3
percentage points to the gap. 8 Regional differences do not explain the gap, and potential work
experience explains only a small part.
Interestingly, the industry distribution of blacks does not contribute to why blacks have
higher rates of unemployment in April 2020, but instead works in the opposite direction. Blacks
actually have a “favorable” industry distribution meaning that overall they are more likely to be
concentrated in industries that were hit less hard by COVID. The magnitude of this contribution,
however, is not very large working to narrow the gap in unemployment by 0.3 percentage
points (i.e. if blacks were in the same industries as whites their unemployment rate would have
increased by 0.3 percentage points).
Occupation, education and industry all worked in the same adverse direction and
contributed to the higher rates of unemployment among Latinx than whites. The less

8

We collapse the major occupation codes listed in Table 4 into three broad categories related to broad skill levels
requirements (management, professional and related; service, sales and office; and blue collar). Collapsing
categories from the 11 major occupation codes is necessitated by the overlap of some categories with major industry
codes.

22

“favorable” occupation distribution accounts for 2.2 of the 5.4 percentage point gap. Lower
levels of Latinx education explained an additional 1.1 percentage points, and industry explains
0.2 percentage points. The regional distribution and lower work experience also contributed to
the Latinx/white gap.
Unemployment in April 2020 included a component related to longer-term structural
unemployment that differs by race, and a new COVID related component. We attempt to
separate these components in two ways. First, we estimate decompositions for newly
unemployed in April 2020 (i.e. those with an unemployment spell of less than or equal to 2
months). We remove observations with unemployment spells of more than 2 months from the
sample because they are not “at risk” of becoming unemployed due to COVID-19. Second, we
estimate a decomposition using February 2020 data to identify longer-term structural
explanations that predate shelter-in-place restrictions. 9
Appendix Table A.1 reports estimates for the newly unemployed in April 2020. The
decomposition results essentially show the same results. The main decompositions are mostly
capturing the explanations for why the racial gaps exist in unemployment in April 2020 which is
consistent with the newly unemployed comprising the bulk of unemployment in April 2020.
One difference is that the black industry distribution appears to have protected blacks from
new unemployment more relative to whites than for total unemployment in April 2020.
Comparing the main results to February 2020 (Appendix Table A.2) the primary difference is
that for blacks and Latinx occupation differences contribute much less to the gap in
unemployment rates. Skill distributions as measured by education levels also contribute less to

9

Estimates are similar when we focus on earlier time periods from January 2017 to December 2019.

23

the gaps in unemployment rates in February 2020. Finally, Appendix Table A.3 reports results
for the decomposition using a partially expanded definition of unemployment by defining those
employed but absent job as unemployed. The added group of NILF-want job are excluded
because they do not have industry and occupation codes. Using this expanded definition the
results are roughly similar to those reported in Table 5.

5. Conclusions
Social distancing restrictions that closed down many businesses in the United States due
to COVID-19 created an unprecedented increase in unemployment. The impacts of COVID-19
on unemployment were felt across the population, but created a downturn dissimilar to
previous recessions when viewed by race. We provide a first examination of whether minorities
were disproportionately negatively affected by COVID-19 using data from April 2020. In
addition to providing new estimates from the CPS data we use difference-in-difference
estimates and non-linear decomposition techniques to identify impacts and their causes.
African-Americans experienced an increase in unemployment in April 2020, but unlike in
previous recessions, the 2:1 ratio of black relative to white unemployment rates did not hold.
COVID-19 resulted in, at most, a slightly disproportionate impact on black relative to white
unemployment, but smaller than in the Great Recession. Blacks were partly protected because
of a favorable mix of the industries in which they are employed. An unfavorable distribution of
employment across occupations and lower skills, however, contributed to higher
unemployment rates in April 2020.

24

In contrast to the impacts on blacks, Latinx were unequivocally hit disproportionately
hard by COVID-19. Unemployment rates rose much faster for Latinx than for blacks or whites in
April, the first month beyond the shelter-in-place restrictions. The occupations, industries, and
skill-levels of Latinx placed them in an especially vulnerable position to the immediate layoffs
that occurred as a result of the coronavirus.
In response to stated concerns from the BLS regarding the possible misclassification of
substantial numbers of those who were not at work and those who wanted a job but perhaps
could not look due to the coronavirus, we tabulated an alternate unemployment series that we
consider to be an upper-bound measure of unemployment. Prior research indicates that
minorities are more likely to leave the labor force in the wake of job loss so including those who
report being NILF but want a job may provide a more complete gauge of COVID-19 on
nonemployment. If closures are prolonged, then those who are absent from their work but
being paid may ultimately be laid off. Accounting for these possibilities with a new upperbound unemployment series raises the national unemployment rate to 26.5 percent in April,
higher than the peak observed in the Great Depression. The upper-bound measure results in
extremely alarming unemployment levels of 31.8 percent for African-Americans and 31.4
percent for Latinx.
These racial patterns in unemployment impacts are important and likely have major
impacts on a wide range of short- and long-term economic outcomes. Minorities in general
have less financial reserves (Canilang et al. 2020) and the partial shutdown of the economy is
likely to lead to immediate difficulty in meeting basic needs like nutrition and healthcare and a

25

wave of late payments on basic bills including housing. 10 If shelter-in-place restrictions continue
for several more months and the economy slips into a longer-term recession, additional waves
of economic disruptions are likely to follow. Perhaps, most importantly the ramifications of
these unemployment spells will worsen longer term trends in earnings, income and wealth
inequality.

10

In the first week of April, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors fielded a survey of 1,000 families finding that
among job losers, furloughs and lost hours workers, 35 percent reported that they would not be able to pay their
monthly bills in full.
