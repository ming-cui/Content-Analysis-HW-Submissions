Health vs. Wealth? Public Health Policies and the Economy During Covid-19
Zhixian Lin and Christopher M. Meissner
NBER Working Paper No. 27099
May 2020
JEL No. E24,E3,E71,Z18
ABSTRACT
We study the impact of non-pharmaceutical policy interventions (NPIs) like “stay-at-home”
orders on the spread of infectious disease. Local policies have little impact on the economy nor
on local public health. Stay-at-home is only weakly associated with slower growth of Covid-19
cases. Reductions in observed “mobility” are not associated with slower growth of Covid-19
cases. Stay-at-home is associated with lower workplace and more residential activity, but
common shocks matter much more. Moreover, job losses have been no higher in US states that
implemented stay-at-home during the Covid-19 pandemic than in states that did not have stay-athome. All of these results demonstrate that the Covid-19 pandemic is a common economic and
public health shock. They also show that policy spillovers and behavioral responses are
important. The tradeoff between the economy and public health in a pandemic depends strongly
on what is happening elsewhere. This underscores the importance of coordinated economic and
public health responses.

NPIs can be important in decreasing local peak mortality and cumulative mortality (Hatchett
et. al, 2007; Markel et. al, 2007; Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007 and Barro, 2020). 1 Countries,
states, counties, and cities recently imposed a number of NPIs to enhance social distancing
with the aim of mitigating the spread of Covid-19. Have these had benefits for public health
but at the cost of the economy? The recent Covid-19 pandemic and associated staggered
implementation of local NPIs allows us to gauge whether such policies have been effective
for public health today and if there are economic costs to these policies.

We have three main results using data from US states and counties. Our county
analysis uses a border discontinuity design in a sample of contiguous counties spanning state
borders. This allows us control for unobservable heterogeneity at the local level while still
achieving variation in policy choices. First, our analysis shows NPIs are only weakly
associated with slower growth rates of confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the state level. 2 These
results are likely due to reverse causality, selection or spillovers. When we compare US
counties with “stay-at-home” to counties across a state-border where there is no “stay-athome” order, there is no differential effect of these NPIs on the growth rate of confirmed
cases. This could be evidence that policy changes have spillovers on behavior in other states.

Our second main result is about spillovers. We show that NPIs from other states may
matter for local outcomes. Policies in other states potentially alter the information set even
in places without NPIs resulting in seemingly coordinated behavior. Behavioral changes,
even in the absence of policy could also be important. Third, there is little evidence that local
stay-at-home orders are associated with declines in local economic activity that are
substantively larger than in places without stay-at-home. Stay-at-home orders do limit
“mobility” and activity around the workplace while boosting residential activity. Still,
common shocks to the economy have much larger explanatory power in explaining economic
outcomes.
Gauging the economic consequences of public health policies of global pandemics is
challenging. Global pandemics are rare events (Barro et. al. 2020; Jordà et. al, 2020 and
Correia et. al 2020), and economic theory has lagged somewhat. New insights combining
economic and epidemiological modeling are emerging with new theoretical predictions. The
key tradeoff is between public health and the economy (Gourinchas, 2020 Acemoglu et. al.

1 Hatchett et. al. (2007) find local NPIs reduce “peak mortality” but find mostly statistically insignificant impacts

on cumulative mortality in their sample of 17 cities in 1918-19. Barro (2020) finds the same in a broader
sample of US cities for 1918-20. Dave et. al (2020) studies “shelter-in-place” in the US states during the Covid19 pandemic finding. They study the impact on the level of cases and deaths from Covid-19, and find, as we do
in our state sample, that NPIs are associated with lower cases but are not statistically associated with deaths.
They study how the impact of NPIs depends on various observable characteristics of states. They do not study
spillovers nor the economic impact of NPIs as we do, nor do they have a county-level analysis. Courtemanche
et. al. (2020) use the near-universe of US counties between 1 March and 27 April and find a negative impact of
“shelter-in-place” on the growth rate of Covid-19 cases. They do not use a matched county pair sample as we
do nor do they study the economic implications of NPIs as we do.
2
We find no relationship between NPIs and the growth rate of cumulative mortality. We largely focus on the
growth of confirmed cases economic outcomes.

2020). 3 In theory, aggressive NPIs benefit public health and help manage the health care
resources in a pandemic, especially with limited medical capacity. In many theoretical
models, NPIs may however damage the economy and create high levels of unemployment.
But, even without policy, people pay attention to news and events elsewhere reacting with
spontaneous social distancing (Eichenbaum et. al. 2020; Baldwin, 2020; Krueger et. al, 2020).
There may also be important economic spillovers to NPIs (Beck and Wagner, 2020).
Economic interdependence alters the tradeoff between disease and the economy by shifting
the policy frontier representing the tradeoff (see Figure 1 in Acemoglu et. al., 2020).

A pandemic can impact an economy in many ways even without public health policy:
reductions in people’s willingness to work, dislocations in consumption patterns and lower
consumption, added stress on the financial system, and greater uncertainty leading to lower
investment. These are respectively referred to as (labor) supply shocks, demand shocks,
financial shocks and uncertainty shocks. Connected economies and epidemiological
communities also move in synch. Even a healthy economy, or an economy that has not
mandated a shutdown, may feel the impact of external events. With the exception of the
1918-20 influenza, recent pandemics have neither had as large of a global impact, nor has
there been as much real time data available to empirically assess the economic and public
health impact of NPIs. We study outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic and find little
impact of NPIs on growth rates of cases, growth rates of deaths, and the economy. The policy
tradeoff between health and the economy seems limited especially at the local level.
The reason we find no evidence consistent with a health/economy tradeoff is that
epidemiological and economic shocks have been common to the US and indeed to the world.
It is difficult to save a local economy when key trade partners’ economies are suffering. 4
Behavioral responses to the disease environment, independent of public health policy, also
imply that outcomes are not entirely related to local policy choices - especially in the early
stages of an outbreak.

We also address the issue of spillovers in NPI policy and public health: do local
policies have effects on other jurisdictions and territories? We find they might, at least within
the United States. Evidence based on mobility and activity from Google “mobility” reports,
suggests behavior is highly correlated in neighboring states after policies that limit
movement like stay-at-home are implemented. In light of this, delaying implementation of
NPIs may have little extra economic benefit when significant trade partners have already
implemented such policies and when information and disease travel rapidly. This evidence
can account for the lack of a tradeoff between health and the economy.

3

Adda (2016) studies the connection between NPIs and viral infections in a connected economy.
Andersen et. al. find evidence that economic activity in Sweden and Denmark were highly correlated despite
Sweden having imposed more limited NPIs than Denmark. Correia et. al (2020) find no economic negative
impact of NPIs during the 1918-19 influenza in the US.

2. Methods
2.1 Data collection
For public health data in US states and counties, we rely on confirmed cases and
deaths of Covid-19 reported by the New York Times on a daily basis. These data are based on
reports from state and local health agencies. We have data for 50 US States + the District of
Columbia as well as over 2000 US counties. We use data for the US between 1 March 2020
and 25 April 2020 with exact samples depending on data availability. 25 is one of the last
days before localities began to loosen their NPI policies.

Data on “stay-at-home” orders at the US state-level is from the official orders or
announcements made by public health authorities at each state and is made available from
the New York Times (see the data appendix for a description of stay-at-home and other
NPIs). We also hand collected county-level data for various NPIs and county-level stay-athome orders for over 150 counties which are matched to counties along the state borders.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first such systematic compilation of such countylevel data.

Eight states had no state-wide stay-at-home order (Arkansas, Iowa, North and South
Dakota, Nebraska and Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming) according to the New York Times
dataset we use. Several counties and localities in Utah and Wyoming issued stay-at-home
orders despite no (or very late) state-wide coverage of stay-at-home. In Oklahoma about
nine localities/counties including Tulsa and Oklahoma City issued stay-at-home orders. In
other states such as Iowa, Nebraska and Arkansas, counties took action by closing schools,
limiting public gatherings and closing dine-in restaurants or by issuing their own stay-athome orders. In general, no counties opted out of state-level restrictions until April 27th after
our data ends.
Real-time data that helps understand the macro economy is relatively scarce and has
only become available in recent decades. Recent research uses real time data from private
financial (fin-tech) companies to track consumer spending as well as movement based on
privately collected GPS signals from mobile phones. Such data is subject to measurement
error, reports for limited and small samples, and cannot be considered as fully indicative of
the macroeconomic situation (Baker et. al. 2020). Nevertheless, we rely on “mobility” data
from Google as proxies for economic activity, and to gauge the impact of stay-at-home on
behavior. These are daily data on number of visits and length of stay in particular types of
locations (retail, grocery, parks, transportation hubs, workplaces, and residential areas).
They are measured as the percentage deviation from a baseline established in January and
early February 2020.

We also use initial claims for unemployment insurance published by the US
Department of Labor (i.e., initial jobless claims) at the state level on a weekly basis. Each
state’s data are as of the end of the week (i.e., Saturday). We use data which are not
4

seasonally adjusted and which are subject to revision. Initial jobless claims represent a
consistent and reliable indicator of the US labor market at the local level, are of reasonable
quality, and are often used as a leading indicator for macroeconomic forecasts. These data
exclude the self-employed. We also supplement the economic data with information on the
employment shares in selected industries we believe may be hardest hit in the recent months
such as oil and gas extraction, retail, food processing/restaurants, wholesale and arts,
recreation and leisure. We also use information on the share of jobs in a state that can be
carried out at home to see if this mitigated the impact of stay-at-home (Dingel and Neiman,
2020).
2.2 Data Analysis
Our main dependent variables are the daily changes of the (natural) logarithm of
cumulative confirmed cases or deaths of Covid-19. We acknowledge considerable debate
about measurement error due to variable testing rates across localities. We allow for local
county-pair specific shocks in order to avoid this potentially confounding effect. Potential for
measurement error also exists for the mortality data. There have been cases of deaths at
home from those not admitted to nor tested in hospitals. Using excess mortality is
theoretically an option but systematic data is not readily available nor directly comparable.

We also use the logarithm of initial jobless claims at the state-level as a dependent
variable. Data are not seasonally adjusted since such adjustments apply to all cross-sectional
units (i.e., states) and are captured in period/day intercepts. Initial jobless claims are subject
to revision. Our data end with information on the week ending 4 April. The latest revisions
apply to weeks before and including the week ending 28 March, 2020.
In addition to state-level data, we use county level data in order to help define better
control groups as in Dube et. al. (2010). Our US county sample matches contiguous counties
from two different states that share a state border. As discussed in Dube et. al. (2010), using
all neighbors of a given county as a control group is not feasible. At the US county-level we
have total cases and deaths of Covid-19, stay-at-home orders (if different from the state),
county-level NPIs, as well as the Google mobility data. We use cases of Covid-19 and the
Google mobility data as dependent variables in an attempt to measure the impact of statelevel stay-at-home policies on health and the economy. We also investigate whether Covid19 cases and mobility are related directly.

State and county-level NPIs vary in their particular prescriptions. Many counties and
states instituted NPIs like school closures, limited public gatherings and closed dine-in
restaurants and casinos, etc. Stay-at-home orders at the state or county level typically
mandate that people refrain from meeting in groups, limit physical social interaction to
within households, and that people frequent only essential businesses. In person work is
allowed only for “essential” businesses.
5

Throughout our paper, we assume that the decision to adopt and the timing of NPIs
and stay-at-home are exogenous and uncorrelated with unobservables especially
expectations about the future path of mortality and the expected path of economic and social
variables of interest. Still, we allow for leads of stay-at-home policies and show results from
event studies to deal with the issues of reverse causality and pre-event trends.

We allow for policy spillovers by measuring the level of policies in all other states. In
our international sample, we look at policies of other countries that share a border. Each
policy in another state (or country) is divided by the centroid-to-centroid distance. For
robustness we also population weighted each other state’s distance weighted policy. States
with closer proximity to the observation have a bigger potential spillover since we assume
economic and social interactions are roughly linear in the log of physical distance with an
elasticity of -1. The measure for state i of all other states’ NPI policies is 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖,−𝑖𝑖 =
∑𝑗𝑗≠𝑖𝑖

1(Stay−at−Home𝑗𝑗 =1)
distance𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

. We also introduce the sum of policies in the states which share a

′
border with state i, 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖,−𝑖𝑖
= ∑ 𝑛𝑛 1(Stay-at-Homen = 1) where n indexes states in the set N of
i’s neighboring states. Similarly, we can control for the confirmed cases of other states with
distance weighting and in neighboring states.

In all models we include controls for calendar weeks or calendar day fixed effects,
state-level fixed effects and event-time trends (linear and quadratic, but cubic terms were
tested). The event is defined either as the number of days elapsed between the current date
and the date a state reached the first death or first confirmed case of Covid-19. We also
cluster standard errors of estimated coefficients at the state level or employ two-way
clustering as discussed below.
3. Results: Policy, Public Health, and the Economy

As of mid-April 2020, there were over one million confirmed cases in the United
States. The US average growth rate of cases for the 56 days between 1 March (76 cases) and
25 April (938,154 cases) was 18.3%. In New York state the number of cases grew from one
on 2 March 2020 to 282,143 on 25 April (average growth rate = 25.63%). Other populous
states had slightly lower growth rates: Texas (20.14%), California (14.8%), and Florida
(19.1%). Deaths from Covid-19 began to grow quickly after the first week in March. New
York’s cumulative crude death rate from Covid-19 per 100,000 population grew to 113, the
highest in the nation by 25 April. The next five states ranked on this metric (as of 25 April)
were New Jersey (66), Massachusetts (39), Connecticut (52.3), and Louisiana (36.7). The
states with the lowest rates were rural or more isolated from the continental United States:
Utah (1.27), Alaska (1.23), Wyoming (1.20), South Dakota (1.13) and Hawaii (0.91). We now
explore the determinants and economic environment surrounding these numbers.

3.1 Policies and Public Health
Table 1 shows regression results relating the daily growth rate of Covid-19 cases and
stay-at-home orders at the state-level using daily data. Regressions take the form
Δln(cases𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾( 𝑁𝑁𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + time𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + time2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where states are indexed by i, 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator variable for whether the state had
adopted a stay-at-home order on day t, 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 is a set of calendar day fixed effects, time and its
square measure event time as the number of days since the first death from Covid-19, and
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an error term. Data are for 1 March through 25 April.

Column 1 of Table 1 shows that a state’s own policy was associated with a reduction
of the growth rate of 2.9 log points (p-value = 0.026, 95% C.I. -0.003 to -0.053). Figure 1
shows the dynamics using an event study approach. We compare the change in the daily
difference of log total confirmed cases in states with stay-at-home to those without this
policy in each five day period before and after the policy change (nine coefficients). The
omitted reference group is the six days up to and including the policy change. The point
estimates are statistically significant only after a lag of about 26 days suggesting that policies
reduced the growth rate of Covid-19 cases at the state level. 5 There is no evidence of a pretrend in the growth rate of cases.

We continue our analysis by investigating policy spillovers between states from NPIs.
A large majority of public schools across the nation were closed from around 16 March for
instance. Other NPIs and stay-at-home were rolled out more progressively.

We test for spillovers in a linear regression in Table 1. In these regressions, we allow
for stay-at-home policies in all other states to matter for state i. Policies in other states are
population and distance weighted. We also allow for differential effects of policies of
neighboring states’ policy by policies in other states with a border state indicator dummy
variable. We also allow for the level of confirmed cases in other states to affect growth of
cumulative cases. We interact all other-state policies with an indicator for the calendar week
to investigate how the timing of other state policies interacts with the cumulative policies up
to that given week.

Own-state policies are always associated with lower growth rates of confirmed cases
after controlling for other state policies. The point estimate after controlling for spillovers in
column 4 is -0.021 (p-value =0.071, 95% C.I. -0.045 to 0.001). This is one-fourth of the
magnitude of the own-state policy in column 1 of Table 1 when we do not control for other
state policies.

Spillovers matter -- especially after groups 2 and 3 had adopted. Policies in other
states dating from the week ending March 28th are negatively associated with growth of
Courtemanche et. al. (2020) control for growth of testing capacity at the state level. We do not. They find no
substantive impact on their point estimates of various NPIs in the regression model for state-level daily changes
in total cases – a model almost identical to ours in terms of specification.

cases even in states that had yet to impose a stay-at-home policy. The association between
local growth rates of confirmed cases and the second group of states’ policies is the largest.
Column 4 shows the point estimate is -3.324 (p-value = 0.008 95% C.I. -.0.92 to -5.72). An
extra policy (in the week ending 28 March) at the median distance between states is
associated with a decline of about one-fifth of a log point or -0.002 (-0.002 = (1/1688) x 3.324). A new policy by a neighboring state, with the median in-sample centroid-to-centroid
distance is associated with a decline of almost one log point or -0.008 (-0.008 = (1/441)*3.324). This is about one-third as large as the own-state point estimate. There is no
statistically significant differential in the marginal impact of bordering states versus more
distant states after accounting for distance between state centroids.
The association for stay-at-home policies in weeks 3 and 4 declines in absolute
magnitude and statistical significance in columns 2-4. By the third week, the marginal effects
of policies in other states are not statistically significant. This is suggestive of the idea that
the wave of stay-at home policies at the state level implemented between March 19th
(California) and March 28th had a bigger impact than later waves. We also cannot reject the
hypothesis that the level of deaths in other cities (weighted by distances between cities) has
no relationship with own-city growth rates of cases ceteris paribus.
form

We now move to analysis of a matched border county sample. Regressions take the
Δln(cases𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) = 𝜇𝜇𝑝𝑝 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾( 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) + time𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + time2𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

where counties are indexed by c, 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the county-level stay-at-home policy, 𝜇𝜇𝑝𝑝 is
a set of county-pair fixed effects, and other variables are defined as in the state sample. Data
are for 1 March through 25 April. Counties may appear in more than pair. We cluster
standard errors at the state level and in the “border segment” which includes all of the border
pairs for two states that share a border (e.g., all counties on the California/Nevada border
would be in a border segment). We weight all regressions with county-population.
Along the state borders at the county level, stay-at-home policies are not associated
with any differential impact on the growth of confirmed cases. Counties on the side of the
border that had no stay-at-home have growth trajectories of cases similar to those counties
with stay-at-home policies. Figure 2 shows results from an event study regression model
with 6,068 county-day observations and 113 county pairs. It contrasts starkly with the statelevel results in Figure 1 which showed a pronounced decline in the growth rate of cases after
implementation of stay-at-home. 6

6 We also ran an event study for the change in the logarithm of deaths from Covid-19. In the county matched
border pair sample, there is no significant difference in these changes between stay-at-home counties and
counties without stay-at-home. The change in log deaths is significantly lower in counties prior to adoption
than in other non-adopting counties- suggesting a process of selection. If we use the earlier date for softer NPIs
such as school closures and limited public gatherings, there is no significant impact of NPIs on the change in log
deaths either. Also, in the state-level data, we see no statistically significant impact of stay-at-home on the
change in the logarithm of deaths relative to states without stay-at-home.

8

The results in Figure 2 are consistent with policy spillovers. People in counties
without rigorous stay-at-home policy may have taken a behavioral cue from nearby
counties/states with such policies. There is also the possibility that heterogeneity explains
the differences between results in Figure 1 (state-level) and Figure 2 (county-level). Perhaps
non-border/“interior” counties in states that adopted stay-at-home took other actions to
limit spread, were more likely to socially distance themselves due to individual behavior or
regulations, or were simply more apt to comply with stay-at-home than in states that did not
have such a policy. Along the border, where the control group is more circumscribed, these
differences dissipate. This implies local policy itself was unlikely to be the sole determinant
of growth in cases in these places. Behavioral responses in counties without stay-at-home
policy may still be affected by policy, but those policies may be in neighboring counties.

In Table A1 we regress the change in the logarithm of cases at the county level on
Google mobility measures in our matched border sample. None of the mobility measures
have a significant impact on the growth rate of cases. There seems to be no significant
relationship between the growth of cases or deaths and the state of the local economy
assuming that the mobility data are correlated with economic activity.

We show below that local stay-at-home policies seem to have been associated with
some changes in the mobility indexes. However, the growth rate of cases is neither
associated with stay-at-home nor measured mobility. The dominant factors explaining the
growth in cases seem to be the calendar days and the time trends. It may be possible that the
google mobility measures are poor measures of actual levels of social distancing or that other
channels such as within family or within residence (e.g., nursing homes) transmission are
dominant too.
3.2 Policies and the Economy: Local Evidence
We first analyze the impact of stay-at-home orders on the google mobility measures.
These are potential indicators of the success of the stay-at-home in achieving social
distancing as well as measuring the impact on the economy. Figure A1 shows the time series
of the google mobility measures in the matched county border sample for places that
eventually adopted stay-at-home versus those counties that had never adopted. There is
significant correlation between the two series implying stay-at-home orders are not entirely
driving individual reactions. Moreover, the time series show significant movement before
stay-at-home orders were effective in both types of counties. The major declines for work
and retail come around the days of 11-16 March. These are the dates around which many
places announced school closures and limited public gatherings. The drops occur
simultaneously in stay-at-home counties and places that never adopted these policies. This
suggests people reacted to common information prior to policy implementation and to
policies in other jurisdictions.
9

Table A2 shows regression results. Figure 3 shows event study results for work and
residential activity. Our regressions control for a quadratic time trend in event time, calendar
day fixed effects and county pair fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the state and
“border segment” level and we weight by county population. Un-reported results allow for
a border-pair by day interaction term and results are highly similar in qualitative terms.

In our matched border sample, workplace, retail, transit, and park activity in counties
with stay-at-home declined more than in those counties without stay-at-home. Residential
activity increased more in counties with stay-at-home. The differences are not necessarily
economically large being on the order of -2.48 percentage points for work (95% C.I. -3.65 to
-1.38) and 1.44 percentage points for residential activity (95% C.I. 0.89 to 2.03). The mean
values of the mobility indexes for work and residential were -34% and 14.76% respectively
by 18 March.
A large fraction of the drop in activity appears to be driven by a common shift
downwards in mobility as indicated by the set of calendar day fixed effects. These common
shifts preceded, or were coincident with, school closures and declarations of states of
emergency. The day indicators for work mobility become consistently negative on 10 March
(point estimate -5.1, p-value = 0.004, 95% C.I. -8.43 to -1.76) and fall strongly and
monotonically so that by 19 March the common (conditional) shift as per the day indicators
is at -45.33 percentage points (p-value = 0.000 95% C.I. -42.22 to -42.44). We have coded
the dates of school closures or earlier implementations of NPIs such as limitation on dine-in
restaurants; un-reported results show that these alternative dates for NPIs are statistically
insignificant.

Figure 3 confirms that after stay-at-home policy implementation there is a differential
impact on mobility between counties that have a stay-at-home policy and those that do not.
These effects become larger over time. After 20 to 24 days, a county with stay-at-home has
roughly 7 percent lower work “mobility” than a county without stay-at-home. There are also
dynamics for residential activity. After 20 days, counties with stay-at-home are roughly 3.5
percentage points higher in terms of residential activity compared to non-stay-at-home
counties. Retail activity using the Google mobility data also shows a strong decline in the
stay-at-home counties relative to non-stay-at-home counties.

Overall, stay-at-home does seem to reduce workplace activity, induces people to stay
near home, and reduces retail activity. Still, even though the magnitude of the relationships
increase in absolute magnitude over time, they are a small fraction of the overall change.
Compare the event study model predictions of a 7 % drop in work mobility after twenty days
to the average predicted decline of 35% or the 3.5% predicted increase in residential activity
to the conditional rise of 14.76% cited above.
Pre-trends are also somewhat evident. Work mobility was somewhat higher and
residential mobility lower in counties that eventually adopted stay-at-home in the weeks
before the policy. It is hard to understand these pre-event trends, but anticipation of reduced
mobility might have led people to inter-temporally substitute and work more prior to the
10

onset of the stay-at-home policy. Our bottom line is that policy may have some impact on
economic activity, as measured by Google mobility indexes, but common effects seem to have
much larger effects. 7

In Table 2 we show that (the logarithm of) state-level applications for unemployment
insurance (i.e., jobless claims) rose more slowly (or at least no more strongly) in states that
adopted stay-at-home policies as in states without stay-at-home. The point estimate is -0.309
(p-value = 0.108 95% C.I. -0.675 to 0.069). Based on this, there is no evidence that stay-athome policies led to stronger rises in jobless claims. In un-reported results, we found that
none of the mobility measures are significant determinants of initial jobless claims after
including state and day fixed effects.
We also explore an event study for jobless claims and find that stay-at-home was
associated with lower increases in unemployment with a lag. In columns 2 (not population
weighted) and 3 (population weighted regressions) the association between stay at-home
policies and jobless claims is statistically significant and negative two and three weeks after
implementation. The coefficient on the first week is not highly statistically significant. We
also use six leads of the indicators for stay-at-home. None of these leading marginal effects
is statistically significant implying that pre-policy trends are unlikely to account for the postpolicy rises in initial jobless claims. In un-reported results we included controls for spillovers
as in Table 1. These are not statistically significant, and neither is the own state stay-at-home
indicator.

In Table A2 we explore heterogeneous effects of stay-at-home by checking for a
relationship between stay-at-home and industry-level employment-to-population shares for
selected industries as well as an interaction for the share of jobs in a state that could be
worked from home. 8 We include separate effects for industries that are most likely to be
done “in-person”. For the main effects, we find jobless claims grew most strongly in states
with higher shares of employment in the leisure and recreation industry and in wholesale
distribution and were smaller where employment shares in retail were higher. There is little
straightforward evidence linking stay-at-home to job losses in states with greater
employment shares in occupations and industries at risk to social distancing and NPIs like
in-person sectors such as retail, food and leisure.
Stay-at-home policy does have an intuitively smaller impact on job losses in
proportion to the share of jobs that can be done from home. When we include a control for
the share of jobs that can be done from home and an interaction effect with stay-at-home,
the un-interacted stay-at-home main effect is associated with higher jobless claims with a
point estimate of 2.55 (p-value = 0.064, 95% C.I. -0.159 to 5.27). However, the interaction

7 If we run these event studies at the state level, we find that stay-at-home is associated with significantly lower
work activity and significantly higher residential activity. The pre-policy trends are qualitatively similar.
Results are similar for regressions with all counties with available data and not just contiguous counties.
8
We also interact state-fixed effects with the stay-at-home policy which allows for heterogeneous impacts by
state. The association between jobless claims and stay-at-home indeed varies by state. It is difficult to see a
clear pattern here however.

11

with the share of jobs that can be worked from home is large and negative at -4.93 (p-value
= 0.063, 95% C.I. -10.15 to 0.28). The average share of jobs that can be worked from home is
0.38 implying that states above average and near the top of the distribution, at a share of
about 0.48, felt an impact on jobless claims from stay-at-home roughly 1/3 as large as states
at the mean. It appears that the impact of stay-at-home policies on the economy are also
mitigated by the ability to work from home.
4. Discussion and comment

Stay-at-home, a relatively aggressive NPI, is only weakly associated with lower
growth rates of confirmed cases of Covid-19. There is “spillover” of policies to geographically
proximate units. When we use a matched sample of counties, the impact on growth of cases
of covid-19 is not statistically significant. Variations in mobility are not associated with the
growth rate of cases.

Stay-at-home is a significant determinant of mobility. However, behavioral responses
and spillovers are highly relevant and much stronger predictors consistent with our other
findings about the economy and policy. Mobility was affected strongly by common shocks
associated with national awareness about the severity of the epidemic and as schools
implemented and announced closures around 13 March.
On average, stay-at-home policies are not associated with higher joblessness in the
US states that imposed them than in states that did not. We interpret this as evidence that
the negative economic shocks were national and not local. There is however some evidence
that stay-at-home has sectoral and occupational impacts. States with more jobs that can be
done from home seem to have lost fewer jobs after implementing stay-at-home than states
with fewer such jobs. This effect itself is not highly statistically significant.
Policy has been predicted to matter for the economy, at least in theory. We find no
strong evidence of this in our sample. Stay-at-home is not the most economically important
predictor of mobility and its local impact on joblessness is highly dependent on model
specification.

During Covid-19, behavior induced by NPIs like stay-at-home appears to spillover
across states in the US data. These spillovers could arise due to direct limitations on contact
with infected individuals from other jurisdictions. However, it could also be because of a
common informational environment. We find evidence that policies in the first-moving
states matter more for other states than policies from later-moving states. This implies that
part of the impact is due to reaction to news in other states. Such news may indicate the
severity of an outbreak or a pandemic leading to decreases in labor supply and reactive social
distancing even without policies in the locality.
12

Evidence is also consistent with the idea that policies transmit information to other
jurisdictions without policies. Even weeks after implementation, the bulk of the change in
mobility is still accounted for by common shocks. Reduced demand for other states’
products and services from places with stay-at-home could spillover to states without policy
too. State-to-state trade or shipment data would be required to verify and validate this
channel.
The association between own-state/own-county policy and growth of new cases of
Covid-19 is weakened once accounting for neighboring state policies. It is further weakened
by using a control group of counties on the side of a border that has no stay-at-home policy.
This does not imply that local policy is un-necessary or fruitless since we believe that
behavior responds to neighbor state policy. This implies there is justification for policy
coordination if the objective is to mitigate the spread of disease and to reduce mortality.
Externalities imply coordination as per standard economic theory.

Our results show that the state of the global/national economy can shift the frontier
that trades economic loss for lower mortality. Local policy loses traction on local economic
and public health and makes it hard to empirically identify a local tradeoff between health
and the economy. Both economy and public health are somewhat out of the control of local
policy makers in a pandemic. A globally coordinated response may be most appropriate in
this case. In terms of conceptualizing policy in the midst of a pandemic and its relation to
economic theory, it should be recognized that local tradeoffs are very different from
macro/economy wide tradeoffs.
During the re-opening process, results are likely to depend strongly on how public
health and the economy evolve in other jurisdictions. However, this process is likely follow
different dynamics than those outlined here (but in reverse) due to the changing nature of
testing and tracing, population immunity developments, changes in expectations, as well as
other significant policy changes at the national level.

Data Appendix for “Health vs Wealth? Public Health Policies and the Economy During
The Covid-19 Pandemic”

Covid-19 Data, Confirmed Cases and Deaths by Country and US state and territory,
January-April 2020

The data of confirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19 across countries are from the
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) in Johns Hopkins University and
represent a compilation of data reported by the WHO or the official reports from
countries’ public health authorities. Daily updates can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports

The state-level cumulative counts of coronavirus cases and deaths in the United
States are compiled by The New York Times and are originally from the state and
local governments and health departments. Data begins with the first reported case
in Washington state on Jan.21, 2020. Details on the daily updated database can be
found:
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) data - Stay-at-home
The information of stay-at-home orders placed by U.S. states are from the public
orders and announcements made by the state governments or public health
authorities. The timing of these orders being effective is compiled by the New York
Times (Mervosh, Lu, and Swales, 2020).
Details can be found:

Matched Border Pair Sample
We have 113 border pairs and 150 unique counties (some counties are in more than
one pair). The map below shows the counties in our balanced, matched sample. The sample
size is reduced because we require all Google mobility data and Covid-19 case data to be nonmissing for the period between 1 March 2020 and 25 April. Some counties did not report at
least one case on or before 1 March 2020 in which case they are not included.

Mobility Data
Data downloaded from on 11 May, 2020: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/

Data are provided by Google. The description of the data from Google is as follows
(abridged): these data “…chart movement trends over time by geography, across
different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies,
parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Each Community Mobility Report
dataset is presented by location and highlights the percent change in visits to places
like grocery stores and parks within a geographic area…. These datasets show how
visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline…. Changes
for each day are compared to a baseline value for that day of the week. The baseline
is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period
Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.

Data Appendix A2
County and State Level “Stay-at-Home” Orders and other Non-Pharmaceutical
Interventions (NPIs).

This data appendix lists some dates for implementation of various NPIs at the county level.
We list information and contemporary sources for these counties for policies such as school
closures, limitations on public gatherings above certain sizes (500, 50, or 10 were common
numbers) and orders to stop dining-in at restaurants, working out at gyms and gambling at
casinos. These cover the vast majority of NPIs implemented in these counties. These data are
used in our matched county pair sample. We use the date of the country stay-at-home order
if any is noted, otherwise we code the state level stay-at-home date. We also coded a date for
earlier implementation of NPIs (usually school closures) and use these dates for robustness.
It is interesting to note that many counties took action earlier than at the state level and
before national CDC guidance on NPIs. Other information was important too. On 11 March
the NBA canceled its season and President Trump banned travel from Europe. Italy had gone
into lockdown by 10 March. Many counties and school districts had decided to close public
schools by 13 March and these decisions were often effective on 16 March. At the same time,
or in the days surrounding these changes, most counties prohibited dining-in at restaurants
and limited the size of public gatherings. School closures were often initially temporary but
within one to three weeks were made permanent for the entire remainder of the school year.
Connecticut implemented a “containment area” on 10 March.

The first counties to adopt shelter in place in the US were in the Bay Area of Northern
California. These occurred on 17 March. Many other counties were contemplating these
types of policies around the same time. The first state in the continental US to implement a
state-wide stay-at-home was California on 19 March.

AUGUSTA TO INITIATE BUSINESS AND GATHERING
RESTRICTIONS DUE TO COVID-19
Due to the necessity to preserve and protect the public, the city of Augusta, Georgia
has decided to impose restrictions on certain businesses and social gatherings. This
executive order will go into effect on March 22nd at midnight and will remain in
place through April 4, 2020. The city reserves the right extend and/or expand
imposed guidelines for the health and well-being of the public.
This order will restrict entertainment venues, gyms and fitness studios, body care,
convention centers, and dine-in activity at bars and restaurants, and public events
and private gatherings that would violate the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) recommendation.
Per the order, the City of Augusta is mandating all the listed businesses to cease
operations by the effective date and time.

Operations of these businesses, and both private and public gatherings, could violate
the recommendation from the White House and CDC stating people should not
gather in groups of 10 or more.
This order will not affect essential services. Those include, gas stations, pharmacies,
grocery stores, food banks, convenience stores, banks, hospitals, medical centers,
and laundromats. Restaurants providing take-out, drive thru, and delivery services
can continue to do business.
Critical government functions such as water and sewer, garbage, transportation,
jails, courts, law enforcement, fire protection, and emergency services will also
continue operations.

“The time is now, for us as a city to act and protect the citizens of Augusta, Georgia,”
said Mayor Hardie Davis, Jr. “This is a virus that has no treatment plan, no vaccine,
and continues to spread at a rapid rate. As a community, we must work together to
protect each other.”
37

As of the March 21, 2020 noon update, the Georgia Department of Public Health has
reported 507 confirmed positives cases of COVID-19 with 14 deaths. In Richmond
County, there are nine confirmed cases. This number expected to rise in the coming
days and possibly weeks.

Like so many of you, I’m concerned about novel coronavirus, also known as COVID19. The City of Augusta, along with our community partners that includes the
Department of Public Health, is working to ensure your health and safety as this
virus continues to spread across Georgia and around the nation. Today, I along with
the leaders who stand with me, took several specific steps to protect the health of
everyone in our city:
Effective today we are suspending public access and activities at all recreation
facilities, government buildings and community centers until April1st;

We are changing the event permitting policy to indefinitely suspend the approval of
permits for public gatherings.
City of Augusta permitted, sponsored and produced public events through the
Recreation and Parks Department are suspended until April 1st;
All Augusta public library branches will close to until April 1st;

City of Augusta Senior Centers will be closed to the public until April 1st;
All travel is being restricted for employees;

Nothing slows the spread of COVID-19 as effectively as social isolation, as
frustrating as it may be. While these decisions are not made easily, and we know
how frustrating they will be for many citizens, we have a responsibility to act in the
best interests of everyone’s health and safety.

That goes for our employees too. Today the City of Augusta began implementing
Continuity of Operations Plans (COOPs) that have been prepared by our department
heads under the direction of the Interim Administrator and EMA Director.
The COOPs allow for some telecommuting in order to reduce the number of
employees in city offices and facilities at any given time. Please know that core
services such as trash and brush pickup, police and fire services will not be reduced.
Please continue to refrain from large public gatherings. The White House has issued
new guidance this afternoon recommending that people not gather in groups larger
than 10 people. I want to urge our local businesses to act in accordance with those
recommendations as we will for City of Augusta operations.
38

Stay home if you feel sick and call your primary care provider before coming to a
walk-in clinic or emergency room. Wash your hands, disinfect hard surfaces, and
avoid physical contact. The safety and health of our community and employees are
the top priority and we appreciate everyone’s patience during this time.
Our government will continue to serve the people of Augusta. We are taking every
precaution to limit the spread of the virus in our community.

recommend businesses, institutions, and organizations suspend all public
gatherings and events of 25 people or more until further notice as a proactive
method to limit the spread of the disease. On March 16, President Trump
recommended that gatherings be limited to under 10 people.
RESTAURANTS/BARS
On March 15, Gov. J.B. Pritzker ordered all restaurants and bars to close to dine-in
customers from March 16 through March 30. He’s encouraging commercial kitchens
to remain open for curbside pickup and drive thru services for customers where
possible.

recommended that gatherings be limited to under 10 people.

Last week, the confirmation of a second case of community spread of the
coronavirus in Douglas County — a 46-year-old man whose illness had no known
source — resulted in Ricketts closing schools in Cass, Douglas, Sarpy and
Washington Counties for six to eight weeks. He also ordered restaurants and bars in
those counties to close their dining areas immediately and move to takeout, delivery
or curbside-only service until further notice.
Douglas County health officials already had issued a public health order prohibiting

Aiken County is in a unique position compared to other counties in South Carolina in

that Aiken County abuts the Georgia border. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued an
Executive Order earlier this week instructing residents to "shelter in place” in their

residences except to conduct essential business. The order went into effect at 6 p.m.
Friday and is currently set to expire at 11:59 p.m. on April 13.

"We're the one state in the country that hasn't called for a shelter in place," Council

member Ed Woltz said. "The fact that we haven't done it yet as a state is disappointing

to me. I think it sends a message of what we think about ourselves, and what we think
Horry

about other people in the country."

Utah state issues “stay safe, stay home”, county follows the state directive.

Governor Gary R. Herbert has issued a “Stay Safe, Stay Home” directive to all
Utahns. This is not a shelter in place order, but rather the next step in the Urgent
Phase laid out in the Utah Leads Together plan. This directive seeks to make clear
what individuals and businesses should do to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our
state and communities.

Goals of the directive are to flatten the curve, reduce the strain on hospitals and the
healthcare system, and minimize the impact on medical resources for those with
highest need.

like shelter in place

On March 23, Northam issued an order that banned within Virginia all gatherings of
more than 10 people. The order required all public schools to be closed for the
remainder of the current school year. The order also closed all public access to
recreational and entertainment businesses, such as bowling alleys, gyms, and
theaters.[77]

The March 23 order closed "dining and congregation areas" in restaurants, dining
establishments, food courts, farmers markets, breweries, microbreweries,
distilleries, wineries and tasting rooms, but left open all other areas in those types of
businesses. The order also left open certain specified "essential retail businesses"
including pharmacies, grocery stores, and banks (among others

Nearby Larimer County – located in northern Colorado – issued a stay-at-home
order on Wednesday, March 25. Due to similar spelling and proximity of these two
counties, we wanted to reiterate that message to our Laramie County residents.
Although there is no lock down or stay-at-home orders for Laramie County, all
Wyoming residents are urged to stay home whenever possible as announced by
Governor Mark Gordon on Wednesday afternoon. More information on Governor
Gordon's announcement can be found here.
