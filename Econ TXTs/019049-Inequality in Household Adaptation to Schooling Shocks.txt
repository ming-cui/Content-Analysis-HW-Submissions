Inequality in Household Adaptation to Schooling Shocks: Covid-Induced Online Learning
Engagement in Real Time

NBER Working Paper No. 27555
July 2020, Revised November 2020
JEL No. I20,I24
ABSTRACT
We use high frequency internet search data to study in real time how US households sought out
online learning resources as schools closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By April 2020,
nationwide search intensity for both school- and parent-centered online learning resources had
roughly doubled relative to pre-Covid levels. Areas of the country with higher income, better
internet access and fewer rural schools saw substantially larger increases in search intensity. The
pandemic will likely widen achievement gaps along these dimensions given schools’ and parents’
differing engagement with online resources to compensate for lost school-based learning time.
Accounting for such differences and promoting more equitable access to online learning could
improve the effectiveness of education policy responses to the pandemic. The public availability
of internet search data allows our analyses to be updated when schools reopen and to be
replicated in other countries.

Introduction

As schools across the United States closed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, roughly 55 million K-12 students experienced a serious disruption to their school year. Though most schools
quickly began offering some type of virtual education (Hamilton et al., 2020; Lake and Dusseault,
2020), there have been growing concerns about the effects of this unprecedented shift (Malkus,
2020; von Hippel, 2020). In particular, there are fears that low-income students will be unequally
harmed by the shift to online learning, due to less access to online resources to compensate for lost
in-person instruction (Horowitz, 2020). As states and districts consider how to best educate students in the wake of the pandemic, it is critical to better understand the effect of pandemic-induced
school closures on students’ access to online learning resources, particularly for low-income students.
This paper uses high frequency, nationally representative Google search data to document in
real time how parents and students sought out online resources as schools closed in response to
the Covid-19 pandemic. Combining the online search measures with measures of demographic
characteristics by geography, we use a difference-in-difference strategy to estimate how Covidinduced demand for online resources varied by a range of geographic and socioeconomic factors,
including income, internet access and school rurality.
We document three findings new to the research literature. First, we show that pre-Covid
search intensity for online learning resources can be usefully divided into two categories, which
we call “school-centered resources” and “parent-centered resources”. School-centered resources
are platforms typically used by schools to provide instruction, assign work, or communicate with
students (such as Google Classroom or Schoology). Parent-centered resources are more generic
search terms likely indicating parents or students are seeking supplemental learning resources
(such as home schooling or math worksheets). We show that search intensity for school-centered
resources dwarfs that for parent-centered resources and that both follow the school calendar, peaking at the start of each school year and vanishing in the summer.
Second, we show that the onset of Covid dramatically disrupted this usual school calendar
cycle of search intensity, as the pandemic triggered a very large increase in demand for online
1

learning resources. By April 2020, nationwide search intensity for online learning resources had
roughly doubled relative to pre-Covid levels. We find sharp increases in searches for both schooland parent-centered resources, suggesting that increased demand for online support came not
only from schools shifting their mode of instruction but also from parents and students seeking
additional support to fill learning gaps as schools closed.
Third, we show the pandemic substantially widened socioeconomic gaps in searches for online
learning resources. Search intensity rose twice as much in areas with above median socioeconomic
status (measured by household income, parental education, and computer and internet access) as
in areas with below median socioeconomic status. Search intensity for school-centered resources,
for example, increased by 15 percent for each additional $10,000 in mean household income and by
roughly 5 percent for each percentage point increase in the fraction of households with broadband
internet and a computer. Areas with more rural schools and Black students saw lower increases in
search intensity. Socioeconomic gaps widened both between and within the country’s four Census
regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We also show that changes in search behavior
correlate with changes in students’ actual math progress, suggesting online search metrics may be
a useful proxy for educational actions taken by parents and students.
Our work adds to three strands of the research literature. First, our paper shows that internet
search behavior can provide useful, real-time information about education-related actions being
taken by households. Prior work shows the utility of search data in predicting economic and social
outcomes such as parents’ preferences for schools (Schneider and Buckley, 2002), disease spread
(Polgreen et al., 2008), consumer behavior (Choi and Varian, 2012), voting (Stephens-Davidowitz,
2014), and fertility decisions (Kearney and Levine, 2015). Most recently, Goldsmith-Pinkham and
Sojourner (2020) use the volume of online search for unemployment benefits to predict post-Covid
unemployment claims. Our results suggest that search data contain valuable information about
how households react to educational shocks, both in terms of overall use of educational resources
and in heterogeneity in such usage by socioeconomic characteristics.
Second, we measure a new aspect of the digital divide, namely the extent to which households
seek out online learning resources either prompted by their schools or of their own accord. A large

2

literature documents pre-Covid gaps in access to and proficiency in the use digital technologies
by income, education, and family background (Bucy, 2000; Rice and Haythornthwaite, 2006; Jones
et al., 2009; Vigdor et al., 2014). Multiple post-Covid surveys show consistent socioeconomic gaps
in self-reported engagement with remote learning at a single point in time (Barnum and Bryan,
2020). We complement this evidence with the first nationally representative revealed preference
measure of such engagement, based on households’ actual behavior rather than self reports. Ours
is also the first high frequency data brought to bear on this issue, allowing study of the evolution
over time of engagement with online learning resources.1
Third, we provide some of the clearest evidence on one channel through which the Covid-19
pandemic will likely widen socioeconomic educational gaps. Based on prior estimates of school
closure effects from natural disasters and summer months, Kuhfeld et al. (2020) predict that Covidinduced closures will generate substantial learning losses, with the largest negative effects concentrated among low-achieving students. Aucejo et al. (2020) surveyed university students and find
the pandemic lowered on-time graduation rates and job offers, with larger effects among lowincome students. Using data from one online learning platform, Chetty et al. (2020) provide perhaps the only direct measure of Covid-induced learning loss, showing that low-income students
experienced substantially larger and more persistent reductions in learning progress relative to
high-income students. We show that socioeconomic gaps in engagement with online learning resources are not limited to a single platform or location but are a widespread and fundamental feature of the post-Covid landscape. Accounting for household responses to changing school inputs
will be critical for predicting educational effects of the pandemic and policy responses to it, given
evidence that parental and school investments are often substitutes, both in the US (Houtenville
and Conway, 2008) and developing countries (Das et al., 2013; Pop-Eleches and Urquiola, 2013).
Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying learning losses that are beginning to emerge following pandemic-induced school closures and can help inform future policy
responses to schooling disruptions, whether related to the pandemic or not. That search for school1
In another example of how the pandemic exacerbated socioeconomic gaps in online forms of parental compensation
for lost schooling time, Jæger and Blaabæk (2020) use Danish register data to show that pre-Covid income-based gaps
in library e-book takeout rates further increased post-Covid.

centered resources increases more in high income areas suggests either that those areas’ schools
are using online platforms more, that those areas’ parents are more likely to engage with such
platforms, or both. That search for parent-centered resources increases more in high income areas
suggests that, separate from schools’ actions, parents are differentially likely to seek out their own
ways of compensating for their children’s lost learning time.
These results can help policymakers and school leaders formulate more effective responses
to the educational disruptions caused by Covid-induced school closures. Students from lower
income families and schools may require additional attention and resources given lower engagement with online learning resources during spring 2020. Moreover, because remote learning will
likely remain a central piece of the public education system for the foreseeable future (Cleveland, 2020), preventing the widening of achievement gaps may require improving access to home
computers and broadband internet for low income and rural students. Schools may also need
to improve the deployment of remote learning platforms to more equitably engage students and
parents in the use of those platforms.
Whether efforts to close gaps in online learning engagement succeed will only become clear as
new data become available in subsequent school years. One advantage of using publicly available
search data to measure household behavior is that our analyses can be easily updated in real time
when the school year begins in the fall. This will help reveal whether socioeconomic gaps in
engagement with online learning have narrowed since the initial shock of schools closing or if
different remote learning strategies across regions were particularly successful. In addition, the
set of search terms studied can be easily modified to accommodate new online learning resources
as they emerge. Finally, our analyses can be replicated in other countries, particularly ones large
enough to generate search data at sub-national levels such as provinces and cities. The flexibility of
this approach shows promise for understanding the behavioral responses of households to school
closures and developing policy responses in real time to address changing student needs.

Data and Empirical Strategy

2.1

Data

Our outcome measures of search intensity come from Google Trends, which makes publicly available weekly measures of internet search behavior both nationally and by Designated Market Area
(DMA). DMAs, the finest geographic level at which search data are consistently available, are
groups of counties, and 210 mutually exclusive DMAs span the United States.2 The publicly available measure of search behavior for a given term or topic is “search intensity”, which calculates
the fraction of a given area’s Google searches devoted to that term or topic. Raw search volume
and raw search intensity are not available. Instead, Google Trends normalizes measures of search
intensity to allow for comparison of relative intensity over time and across DMAs. Given the
challenge of interpreting such magnitudes, we often use the logarithm of search intensity so that
estimates can be interpreted as percent changes. We implicitly assume increased search intensity
for a term corresponds to increased raw search volume, given evidence that overall Google search
volumes did not change substantially during the pandemic.3
We focus on measuring search intensity for terms related to online learning. We first assembled
a list of 45 potential such keywords, downloaded five years of weekly search data from June 2015
through May 2020, and then ranked the keywords by their nationwide popularity. We then identified the 10 most popular keywords related to branded online learning resources (such as “Google
Classroom” or “Khan Academy”) and the ten most popular keywords for general online learning
resources (such as “online learning”, “home school”, and “math worksheet”). Table 1 shows these
lists and their popularity.4 The most popular of these search terms by far is Google Classroom.
2

DMAs are defined by Nielsen.
For more information, see: https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/
intl-campaigns/dma-maps/.
3
One private firm, Statista, estimates that monthly US-based Google search volumes were 12.7 billion in
April 2020, compared to 11.9 in January 2020, and that such search volumes have held fairly steady between 10 and 13 billion since 2015. See “Number of explicit core search queries powered by search engines in the United States as of April 2020”, accessed at https://www.statista.com/statistics/265796/

archive.
4
For the full list of 45 keywords, see Table A.1. We identified 45 keywords related to K-12 online learning resources
through a combination of theory-driven and data-driven analysis. We began by identifying keywords that, in theory,
relate to online learning, such as the searches for the major online learning platforms (such as “Google Classroom”,
“Khan Academy”) and general searches for online learning resources (such as “online learning”). We augmented this

5

Khan Academy, one of the next most popular terms, was roughly 13 percent as popular as Google
Classroom.5 General (non-branded) learning resources saw substantially lower search intensity
than that.
We combine the ten items in each of these two lists to create two primary measures of search
intensity for learning resources. We do so for three reasons. First, Google Trends does not publicly
report search intensity if the total number of searches in a given area and week falls below a certain
threshold, so combining search terms substantially reduces the amount of missing data. Second,
we are more interested in the general level of demand for online learning resources rather than
the popularity of any one resource. Third, Google Trends restricts the number of keywords whose
total search intensity can be downloaded at one time, which requires us to focus on the most
popular keywords.6 Therefore, our measure of search intensity aggregates the total popularity for
the ten most popular keywords in DMA d in week t as follows

SearchIntensitydt =

10
X
Google searches for [keyword i]

dt

Total Google searchesdt

i=1

.

(1)

Given the ten keywords in each list, we refer to branded learning resources as “school-centered
resources” and general learning resources as “parent-centered resources”. The former list largely
consists of educational platforms, such as Google Classroom and Schoology, that schools use to
connect with students and are typically not used without the school’s involvement. The latter list
consists of general learning resources such as “math worksheets” and “home school”, which we
interpret as parents (or guardians or students themselves) searching for online learning resources
on their own, without particular guidance from a school.7
with a data-driven approach by including additional keywords that were suggested as related by Google Trends. While
it would have been possible to extend this list, we found the marginal return to each additional term was quite low.
The top 3 keywords capture nearly 80 percent of the total pre-Covid search intensity and the top 10 capture nearly
all of the total search intensity. Because the focus of the paper is on K-12 online learning, we excluded keywords related to professional services (“Webex”), textbooks (“Pearson”), postsecondary platforms (“Canvas”), or adult learning
(“Masterclass”).
5
We normalize search intensity across keywords relative to the pre-Covid (March-May 2019) search intensity of
Google Classroom.
6
Nearly all of the search intensity for online learning is concentrated in the top 10 terms in each list as shown in
Table A.1.
7
Khan Academy is perhaps the most ambiguous search term, in that many schools use it to deliver curriculum to
students, but parents and students can also access it without the school’s involvement. We place it in the list of school-

6

To characterize the pre-Covid demographics of each DMA, we use county-level data from
the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) and then generate DMA-level measures as the
population-weighted average across the counties within each DMA.8 We can therefore characterize DMAs by a variety of measures, including: mean household income; median household
income; fraction of adults with a B.A.; fraction of households with broadband internet; and fraction of households with a computer. These five measures are so highly correlated that we refer to
their population-weighted first principal component, which nearly equally weights each measure
and explains 86 percent of their joint variation, as DMA-level socioeconomic status (SES). This
allows us to do simple comparisons of search intensity across high and low SES areas of the country. We supplement ACS data with county-level data from the Stanford Education Data Archive
(SEDA), which provides additional information such as the fraction of schools in rural areas and
the racial composition of the school-age population. As of 2016, 27 percent of adults had a B.A.,
23 percent lived in households without broadband internet access, and 25 percent of schools were
in rural areas.9

2.2

Empirical Strategy

We first estimate changes in nationwide search intensity for learning resources as a result of Covidinduced school closures, using both a week-by-week event study specification and a two-period
before-after specification. The event study specification is

Log(SearchIntensityt ) =

−1
X
t=−39

βt Bef oret +

12
X

βt Af tert + αP riorY earst + µw(t) + λy(t) + εt , (2)

t=1

where we regress on a vector of week indicators the logarithm of nationwide search intensity in
week t. Here, t indicates the event week, which identifies weeks relative to March 1, 2020, when
states began discussing the possibility of school closures. Bef ore and Af ter are indicators for
centered resources but often show separate results for it and for Google Classroom, the two most popular search terms
in the post-Covid period.

In seven cases (0.2 percent of counties), the county is within more than one DMA. In these cases, we include the
county in both DMAs.

See Table A.2 for these and other summary statistics.

week t falling before or after March 1, 2020. Inclusion of week of year w(t) (i.e., 1-52), and school
year y(t) (i.e., 2015-2020) fixed effects, which we call calendar effects, means that coefficients βt
can be interpreted as differences in search intensity compared to the same weeks in prior years.
The vector of weekly indicators covers all 52 weeks (other than that starting March 1, 2020) in the
most recent year of our data, leaving the prior four years of data to identify week of year effects.
Exclusion of the March 1, 2020 indicator, and inclusion of a P riorY ears indicator for observations
in the first four years of the data, means the coefficients βt can be interpreted as week t’s deviation
from calendar-predicted search intensity relative to March 1, 2020.
The nationwide before-after specification, which replaces the vector of weekly pre- and postCovid indicators with a single post-Covid indicator, is

Log(SearchIntensityt ) = βP ostCovidt + µw(t) + λy(t) + εt .

(3)

Inclusion of calendar effects means β can be interpreted as the overall post-Covid increase in
search intensity compared to those same weeks in prior years. We exclude the ramp-up period
of March 2020 from the before-after analysis because school closure discussions began in early
March and nearly all schools were initially closed by states between March 16 and March 23.10
The post-Covid coefficient thus estimates the average increase in search intensity in April and
May of 2020, when schools and parents were fully aware of the scope of educational disruption.
The difference-in-difference estimator β from Equation 3 is the average of the April-May weekly
event study coefficients β4 through β12 from Equation 2.
To study how search intensity changed differentially by SES, we modify our nationwide specifications by interacting the pre- and post-Covid indicators with indicators for whether a DMA is

(βt Af tert + γt Af tert ∗ HighSESd )

t=1

+ α1 P riorY earst + α2 P riorY earst ∗ HighSESd + µw(t) + λy(t) + εt , (4)

so that the coefficients γt estimate the difference in weekly search intensity between high and low
SES DMAs.
We modify the nationwide before-after specification to become a difference-in-difference of the
form

Log(SearchIntensitydt ) = β1 P ostCovidt ∗ HighSESd + β2 P ostCovidt ∗ LowSESd
+ σHighSESd + µw(t) + λy(t) + εt . (5)

Here, β1 and β2 measure the overall post-Covid change in search intensity for high and low SES
DMAs respectively. We then compute the difference between those two coefficients, which corresponds to the average over time of the event study coefficients γ4 through γ12 . We also run
difference-in-difference specifications where the post-Covid indicator is interacted with continuous measures of DMA characteristics, such as income, broadband penetration rates, and school
rurality.
All DMA-level regressions use standard errors clustered by DMA and are weighted by DMA
population to be nationally representative at the individual level. Nation-level regressions use
heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. All regressions exclude weeks with the major school
holidays of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. This has no effect on any estimates of
interest but improves the scale of event-study graphs given the increased noise associated with
such weeks.

Results

Nationwide search intensity for learning resources followed regular annual patterns until March
2020, at which point search intensity dramatically increased relative to similar months in prior
years. As seen in Figure 1, search intensity for school-centered resources typically peaks near the
start of each school year and declines steadily until summer, when it largely vanishes. Search
intensity for parent-centered resources is steadier throughout the school year but also declines
substantially in summer. Covid-related school closures altered these patterns, with nationwide
search intensity for both types of learning resources roughly doubling by late March.11 Search
intensity then starts to decay, likely due to households successfully locating their desired online
resources and to school years ending in May and June. Accounting for usual calendar effects
confirms all of these changes observed in the raw data, with no pre-trends prior to March 2020
and then a large and statistically significant rise in search intensity that then fades by late May.12
Growth in post-Covid search intensity varied substantially by geography and socioeconomic
status. Figure 2 maps DMAs by quartiles of SES (panel A) and post-Covid changes in search intensity (panel B), defined as April-May search intensity differences between 2020 and prior years. Areas with high income, parental education and technological access are concentrated in the Northeast and West coast, as well as Utah and Colorado. Post-Covid search intensity also increases most
noticeably, though not exclusively, in the Northeast and West coast, suggesting that high SES areas
see larger spikes in search intensity for learning resources.
Event study analyses show that weekly search intensity for learning resources increased significantly more in areas with higher income and better technological access. Figure 3 shows Equation 4’s regression-based weekly difference in search intensity between DMAs above and below
median SES, controlling for calendar effects. By mid-March, high SES areas see jumps in search
intensity for both school- and parent-centered learning resources roughly 30 percent higher than
low SES areas. These weekly differences are statistically significant and do not decay with time.
Such differences are also visible in the unadjusted data and when we fully interact the above and

below median SES indicators with the calendar week and school year fixed effects.13
Difference-in-difference analyses show that the average post-Covid increase in search intensity
for learning resources was roughly twice as high in high SES areas as in low ones. Table 2 shows,
in panel A’s before-after analysis based on Equation 3, that nationwide search intensity increased
67 percent (51 log points) for school-based resources, driven largely by a 114 percent (76 log point)
increase for Google Classroom, and 40 percent (34 log points) for parent-centered resources. Panel
B, based on Equation 5, shows that search intensity for all of these resources increased substantially in low SES areas but much more so in high SES areas. Low SES areas searched 36 percent
(31 log points) more intensely for school-centered resources but high SES areas searched an additional 48 percent (39 log points) more intensely, a difference that is highly statistically significant.
Search intensity for parent-centered resources increased by 25 percent (22 log points) in low SES
areas but by an additional 27 percent (24 log points) in high SES areas.14 These patterns hold for
broad resource categories and for individual products like Google Classroom and Khan Academy.
Interestingly, the high SES indicator in panel B’s regressions suggests few clear differences by SES
in search intensity prior to the pandemic.
The pandemic widened gaps in search intensity for learning resources not only by broad measures of SES, but also by specific measures such as income, technological access, rurality and
race. Panel C of Table 2 shows difference-in-difference analyses where continuous DMA-level
demographic measures have been interacted with a post-Covid indicator. Search intensity for
school-centered resources increases by an additional 15 percent (14 log points) with every additional $10,000 in mean household income and by a roughly additional 4-5 percent (3.6 and 4.4
log points) with every percentage point increase in the fraction of households with broadband
internet and a computer. A percentage point increase in technological access is equivalent to approximately a quarter of a standard deviation. A 10 percentage point increase in the fraction of
schools located in rural areas (nearly half a standard deviation) is associated with a 17 percent (16
log point) lower change in search intensity, while a 10 percentage point (two-thirds of a standard

interacts all calendar week and school year fixed effects with above and below median SES indicators.

deviation) increase in the fraction of students who are Black is associated with a nine percent lower
change in search intensity. Parent-based resources show similar patterns, though with somewhat
smaller magnitudes. Measures of SES (such as income or broadband access), school rurality and
race are independently associated with search behavior even when controlling for each other.15
Finally, we note four additional analyses that further illuminate or strengthen the prior results.
First, Table A.5 presents effects by SES quartile. This analysis shows that the observed post-Covid
widening of search intensity gaps is fairly linear in SES and not just driven by the most and least
disadvantaged areas. Second, the widening of gaps by SES is not only the result of SES gaps between regions of the country but gaps within regions. Table A.6 reports effects for each of the four
U.S. Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and shows that SES-based search intensity
gaps appear even when making within-region comparisons. Finally, because search intensity is
coded as zero for terms with low search volume in a given DMA-week, Table A.7 excludes DMAs
with low search volume. The results are unchanged, which is unsurprising given that such areas
tend to have low population.
Fourth, we show that changes in search intensity for educational resources are correlated with
changes in actual math progress made by students, suggesting a relationship between online
search and actual student and parent behaviors that impact educational outcomes. Figure A.4
plots the DMA-level relationship between post-Covid changes in math progress, as measured by
badges earned in the popular math app Zearn, and post-Covid changes in search intensity for
school- and parent-centered resources. For both types of search, we observe a high correlation
(0.70 and 0.55) between changes in search behavior and changes in math progress. Areas where
households began searching much more for educational resources are also those where students
made the most progress in math. This makes more plausible the idea that online search metrics
serve as useful proxies for households’ educational behaviors and investments.

Discussion

We document a sharp increase in searches for learning resources as schools closed in response to
the Covid-19 pandemic. By April 2020, nationwide search intensity for online learning resources
had roughly doubled relative to baseline. The shock of school closures increased demand both
for the specific online platforms schools shifted instruction to (such as Google Classroom) and
for the supplemental resources that households sought out to fill gaps in their learning (such as
math worksheets). The likelihood of future school closures or partial reopenings implies these
supplemental online resources are likely to become important drivers of student learning.
Though demand for online resources increased in both high and low SES areas, the increase
was substantially larger in high SES areas. Areas of the country with higher income, greater internet access, and fewer rural schools had substantially larger increases than less advantaged areas.
Along with results from several contemporaneous studies, these results suggest that academic
gaps across students will be wider than normal in future school years, a result strengthened by
our finding that changes in search behavior correlate with changes in students’ math progress.
Our results suggest the potential value of policy responses that directly address these documented inequalities in engagement with online learning resources. Students in low SES areas and
rural communities are likely to need additional support to overcome the educational challenges
created by Covid-19. Because online learning will likely remain a key component of school systems in the near future, school leaders and policymakers may want to prioritize access to home
computers and broadband internet. Improving access to and engagement with online learning
platforms will likely be an important step to equalizing learning opportunities and preventing a
widening of achievement gaps.
Publicly available, high frequency internet search data helps illuminate the evolution of educational choices made by households, as well as socioeconomic inequalities in those choices. Our
analyses can be updated in real time to study future changes in engagement with online learning,
can be modified to study different search terms, and can be replicated in other countries. Household adaptation to schooling shocks is an understudied phenomenon that can be readily observed
in internet search data. Understanding and accounting for such behavioral responses by parents
13

and students will be critical to predicting the long-term effects of the pandemic.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01). In
panel A, each column regresses the logarithm of the listed topic’s search intensity on a post-March 1 indicator. Panel
B interacts the post indicator with above and below median SES indicators. Below each pair of interaction coefficients
in panel B is the estimated difference between the high and low SES interaction coefficients. Each coefficient in Panel
C comes from a separate regression that interacts the post indicator with DMA-level household mean income or the
other listed resource and demographic measures. Income is measured per $10,000, while the remaining variables are
scaled to interpret coefficients as predicted effects of a 10 percentage point increase in the interacted characteristic.
The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed effects for week of year (1-52) and school year
(2015-2020). The sample contains search data from June 2015 through May 2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks
with major school holidays.

(1-52) with above and below median SES indicators, and interacts fixed effects for school year (2015-2020) with above
and below median SES indicators. As described in the notes for Figure 3, this figure shows event study coefficients
estimating the difference in the logarithm of weekly search intensity between Designated Market Areas (DMA) of
above and below median socioeconomic status. The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed
effects for week of year (1-52) and school year (2015-2020). Also shown are 95 percent confidence intervals calculated
with standard errors clustered by DMA. Panel A shows search intensity for school-centered resources and panel B for
parent-centered resources. The sample contains search data
24 from June 2015 through May 2020, excluding weeks with
major school holidays.

Notes: The figures above show the correlation between DMA-level changes in math progress and changes in search
intensity for school- and parent-centered resources. Change in math progress is measured by the difference in badges
earned (lessons completed) in the Zearn math app, comparing April 1 through May 31 to January 6 through February 21
of 2020. Change in search intensity is measured over the same time period. The Zearn data come from the Opportunity
Insights website. The line of best fit and correlation coefficient are both computed by weighting each DMA by its
population.

Notes: The pre-Covid sample contains search data from March 2019 through May 2019 in the United States. The
post-Covid sample contains search data from March 2020 through May 2020 in the United States. Magnitudes are interpreted as search popularity relative to the popularity of ”Google Classroom” in the pre-Covid time period. Search
terms are not case sensitive, so ”Google Classroom” is equivalent to ”google classroom.” The focus of this paper is K12 online learning resources, so we do not include keywords related to professional services (e.g., Webex), textbooks
(e.g., Pearson), or postsecondary (e.g., Canvas), or adult learning (e.g., Masterclass).

Notes: Panel A presents summary statistics of data from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS). We use
county-level ACS data and generate DMA-level measures as the population-weighted average across the counties
within each DMA. Panel B presents summary statistics of 2016 data from the Stanford Education Data Archive
(SEDA). We again use county-level SEDA data and generate DMA-level measures as the population-weighted average.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
Each column is a separate regression of the logarithm of the listed topic’s search intensity on a post-March 1 indicator
interacted with the DMA-level characteristics shown (and includes their direct effects). Income is measured per
$10,000, while the remaining variables are scaled to interpret coefficients as predicted effects of a 10 percentage point
increase in the interacted characteristic. The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed effects
for week of year (1-52) and school year (2015-2020). The sample contains search data from June 2015 through May
2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks with major school holidays.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01).
Each column in each panel regresses the logarithm of DMA-level search intensity for the listed topic on a post-March
1 indicator interacted with indicators for above and below median DMA-level SES in that Census region, as well
as directly including an above median SES indicator. Below each pair of interaction coefficients is the estimated
difference between the high and low SES interaction coefficients. The regressions are weighted by DMA population
and include fixed effects for week of year (1-52) and school year (2015-2020). The sample contains search data from
June 2015 through May 2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks with major school holidays.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered by DMA are in parentheses (* p<.10 ** p<.05 *** p<.01). In
panel A, each column regresses the logarithm of the listed topic’s search intensity on a post-March 1 indicator. Panel
B interacts the post indicator with above and below median SES indicators. Below each pair of interaction coefficients
in panel B is the estimated difference between the high and low SES interaction coefficients. Each coefficient in Panel
C comes from a separate regression that interacts the post indicator with DMA-level household mean income or the
other listed resource and demographic measures. Income is measured per $10,000, while the remaining variables are
scaled to interpret coefficients as predicted effects of a 10 percentage point increase in the interacted characteristic.
The regressions are weighted by DMA population and include fixed effects for week of year (1-52) and school year
(2015-2020). The sample contains search data from June 2015 through May 2020, excluding March 2020 and weeks
with major school holidays, as well as DMAs with low search intensity in any given week.
