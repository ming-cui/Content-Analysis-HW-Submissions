Abstract
As of June 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has led to more than 2.3 million confirmed infections and 121 thousand fatalities in
the USA, with starkly different incidence by race and ethnicity. Our study examines racial and ethnic disparities in confirmed
COVID-19 cases across six diverse cities—Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York City, San Diego, and St. Louis—at the ZIP
code level (covering 436 “neighborhoods” with a population of 17.7 million). Our analysis links these outcomes to six separate
data sources to control for demographics; housing; socioeconomic status; occupation; transportation modes; health care access;
long-run opportunity, as measured by income mobility and incarceration rates; human mobility; and underlying population
health. We find that the proportions of Black and Hispanic residents in a ZIP code are both positively and statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per capita. The magnitudes are sizeable for both Black and Hispanic, but even larger for
Hispanic. Although some of these disparities can be explained by differences in long-run opportunity, human mobility, and
demographics, most of the disparities remain unexplained even after including an extensive list of covariates related to possible
mechanisms. For two cities—Chicago and New York—we also examine COVID-19 fatalities, finding that differences in
confirmed COVID-19 cases explain the majority of the observed disparities in fatalities. In other words, the higher death toll
of COVID-19 in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities mostly reflects higher case rates, rather than higher fatality
rates for confirmed cases.

Introduction
By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA led to
over 2.3 million confirmed infections, over 121,000 fatalities,
and almost 31,000 hospitalizations (CDC, U. S. Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention 2020, 2020c). Like many other issues pertaining to health and economic disparities, the
burden of the COVID-19 pandemic falls disproportionately
on Black and Hispanic communities. Through June 13,
2020, the rate of hospitalization for Blacks and Hispanics
was more than four times as high as for Whites (CDC, U. S.
2020b). The pandemic is taking a substantial toll on physical,
mental, and economic health across the USA, but disparities in
whom is impacted by the virus are an additional cause for
alarm.
Part of the barrier to carefully studying disparities from the
p a n d e m i c — b o t h t h e i r m a g n it u d e s a n d p o t e n t i a l
explanations—is that current published data on COVID-19
outcomes are coarse (Killeen et al. 2020). Most studies focus
on COVID-19 outcomes at highly aggregated levels such as
the state (Friedson et al. 2020) or county (Courtemanche et al.
2020). Within a state or county—especially in areas with larger populations—residential segregation by race and ethnicity

244

can be quite stark, meaning that analyzing disparities at such
levels misses an important part of the variation. Partway
through the pandemic, a number of local and state governments began producing COVID-19 statistics in a more disaggregated fashion—most commonly reporting confirmed cases
by ZIP code. This paper provides one of the first attempts to
systematically investigate racial/ethnic disparities in COVID19 using these newly available ZIP code level data.
Specifically, we utilize data on confirmed COVID-19 cases
from six cities—New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, San
Diego, and St. Louis—as well as data on fatalities from New
York and Chicago.
Our analysis links these COVID-19 outcomes to six separate data sources to control for ZIP code level demographics,
housing, socioeconomic status, occupational choices, transportation modes, health care access, long-run opportunity (income mobility and incarceration rates), human mobility, and
population health disparities. This rich set of covariates allows
us to investigate the extent to which mechanisms that have
received popular attention—such as income; education; living
in densely populated communities; reliance on public transportation; representation in forward-facing, essential jobs; mobility during lockdowns; pre-pandemic health; and access to
health care—contribute to racial and ethnic disparities
(Harrison 2020; Hubler et al. 2020; Oppel et al. 2020; CDC,
U. S. 2020b). We find statistically significant and economically meaningful disparities for both Blacks and Hispanics at
the ZIP code level in confirmed cases, and most of the disparity is remains unexplained even after including extensive controls. Without additional covariates, a 10 percentage point
increase in a ZIP code’s share of Black residents is associated
with 9.2 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000
residents, while a similar change in the Hispanic share is associated with 20.6 additional cases. Both are sizable changes
relative to the average confirmed case rate of 153 per 10,000
population. Using decompositions that are insensitive to the
ordering of the covariates (Gelbach 2016), we find that at least
part of these disparities can be explained by differences in
long-run opportunity (income mobility and incarceration
rates), human mobility as measured by cell phone activity,
and demographics. However, even with an extensive set of
controls, more than half of the disparity in COVID-19 cases
remains unexplained. For the two cities where we are also able
to examine COVID-19 fatalities, we find that differences in
confirmed COVID-19 cases strongly predict the observed disparities, in fact entirely eliminating the entire association for
proportion Hispanic and the majority of the association for
proportion Black.
The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. We first
examine the rapidly evolving COVID-19 lietarure with respect to disparities due to race and ethnicity. Next, we discuss
our data colection effort. We then provide an empirical model
and findings, and then conclude.

Literature Review
Despite growing recognition about racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19, our study is one the first to systematically
investigate their size and possible explanations at a geographic
level narrower than the county.1 Below, we summarize the
literature on racial disparities pertaining to COVID-19 infections, testing, and deaths, with the caveat that the literature is
rapidly evolving. We then discuss, based on previous work,
limitations on county-level analyses and underlying mechanisms through which disparities could occur.

Nationwide, County-Level Analyses
Several recent studies utilize data on COVID-19 outcomes
from US counties and analyze racial and ethnic disparities.
McLaren (2020) collects county-level data on COVID-19
mortality from the entire USA and links to county characteristics from the American Community Survey (ACS). By
May 19, 2020, the unadjusted disparity shows a 10 percentage
point increase in the Black share corresponding to an increase
of 37.6 additional fatalities per million, with a 10 percentage
point increase in the Hispanic share associated with 9.6 additional fatalities. With additional controls—especially for public transit—the disparities decrease and in some cases become
insignificant (suggesting potential mechanisms for the observed disparity). The study concludes that the disparity for
Blacks is very robust to the inclusion of additional covariates,
although the one for Hispanics is more fragile.
Knittel and Ozaltun (2020) also examine COVID-19 death
rates at the county-level and find mixed evidence of disparities. As of May 27, 2020, in a model with detailed controls
but excluding state fixed effects, a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion Black is associated with a large and
statistically significant increase of 126.2 deaths per million
residents. With state fixed effects included, the estimated disparity shrinks to a still sizeable 46.8 deaths per million but
becomes statistically insignificant. The disparity for proportion Hispanic is not statistically significant in either model and
the magnitudes are much smaller: 18.8 and 9.6 deaths per
million in regressions without and with state fixed effects,
respectively.
Desmet and Wacziarg (2020) examine both confirmed
COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Outcomes are measured as
logarithm of cases or fatalities (plus one) for May 26, 2020,
where logarithm of population is included as a control,
1
In work concurrent to ours, Figueroa et al. (2020) examine disparities in
Massachusetts towns/cities through early May 2020 and found that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black population is associated with a 31.2 increase in COVID-19 cases per 10,000, while a 10 percentage point increase in
the Hispanic population is associated with an increase of 25.8 cases per
10,000. Additional controls attenuate the association between the COVID-19
rate and Hispanic population—but not Black population.

implying the other estimates can be interpreted as the determinants of cases and deaths in per capita terms. They find
highly significant and virtually identical disparities in cases
and fatalities for proportion Black and somewhat smaller standardized coefficients for proportion Hispanic.

neighborhoods). While analyses at even a more finely grained
level than ZIP code (e.g., Census Tract) would be desirable, ZIP
codes offer much more heterogeneity with respect to race and
ethnicity than counties, while also having satisfactory indicators
related to long-run economic opportunity, human mobility, and
other key demographic and health-related information.

Racial Segregation Within US Counties
There is somewhat limited racial and ethnic variation
across counties in the USA, although the share of
minority-majority counties has been increasing since
2000 (Krogstad 2019). Fewer than 5% of all US counties
(151 out of 3143) have either Black, Hispanic, or indigenous people as the majority. As of 2018, there were 72
majority-Black counties, primarily located in the southeastern U.S.; there were 69 counties where Hispanics are
the majority, predominantly in the southwestern U.S.
(Schaeffer 2019). Especially in large US counties, there
can be significant residential segregation, which may hide
racial disparities in COVID-19 that can be more precisely
measured at a more localized level. This limitation is wellunderstood; for example, McLaren (2020) notes “much of
the relevant variation exists at the zip code level.” On a
national level, there are 658 counties that contain 10 or
more residential ZIP codes entirely within the county.2
More than one-third of these counties have large
dispersion—25 percentage points or more—in the share
Black or Hispanic between the ZIP codes with the highest
and lowest shares.
Neither the southeast nor southwest regions were the initial
hotspots for COVID-19 spread, raising the question of whether observed correlations between county racial composition
and COVID-19 death rates are confounded by the staggered
timing in which the disease reached different parts of the
country. The sensitivity of the results of Knittel and Ozaltun
(2020) to the inclusion of state fixed effects is suggestive of
such confounding. Yet including state fixed effects in countylevel disparities regressions could itself be problematic, as it
controls away much of the identifying variation, reducing the
precision of the estimates. Accordingly, their coefficient for
proportion Black becomes statistically insignificant after including state fixed effects despite remaining sizeable at 46.8
deaths per million. Estimating racial disparities with both
credibility and precision therefore appears to require data with
finer-grained geographic detail.
In our analysis of six cities, nearly 31% of ZIP codes we
analyze were minority-majority “neighborhoods” (to borrow
the terminology of Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson (2020)),
who refer to ZIP codes within New York City as

ethnic composition from Social Explorer.

Potential Explanations and Related Evidence
Several factors may explain racial and ethnic disparities in
the spread of COVID-19 and subsequent COVID-19 outcomes. We next explain these theories and associated empirical evidence. Many of the relevant studies examine
New York City in isolation, since it was initially the
hardest hit in the USA, and because of its relatively early
posting of ZIP code level data. Of course, New York City
differs from the rest of the USA in many respects, even
relative to other large cities, so the extent to which these
findings are generalizable is unclear.
One possibility may be the nature of jobs. Many features about occupations, commuting, and the workplace
could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, and may
disproportionately affect people of color. Almagro and
Orane-Hutchinson (2020) argue that occupation is a key
explanatory variable for understanding the early transmission of COVID-19 in New York City, and since minority
workers are more likely than others to be front-line employees or unable to work from home, they are more likely
to be working outside the home during those hours.
Accordingly, Coven and Gupta (2020) find that Black
and Hispanic neighborhoods (measured at the ZIP code
level) in New York City exhibited more daytime work
activity than other neighborhoods during the pandemic
using mobile location data sourced from VenPath. Selden
and Berdahl (2020) examine the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey and find that Black adults in every age group
were more likely than White adults to have health risks
associated with severe COVID-19 illness, and that
Blacks at high risk for severe illness were 1.6 times as
likely as Whites to live in households containing healthsector workers.
Another phenomenon observed in New York City during
the early stages of the pandemic was temporary relocation
outside the city. Ability to relocate depends on whether one’s
job can be done remotely and also whether one has the
financial resources to do so. Perhaps for these reasons,
Coven and Gupta (2020) find that the propensity to leave the
city was strongly negatively associated with the proportion
Black in the Census Tract.
Health care access may also be an important factor, and
the barriers to receiving COVID-19 testing at the onset of

246

the pandemic are well known. However, Schmitt-Grohé
et al. (2020) found that testing services were evenly shared
across the income distribution in New York City’s 177
ZIP codes. Borjas (2020) finds access to testing was
roughly uniform across the share of the ZIP code that
was minority, but the conditional probability of a positive
test result was far greater in neighborhoods with larger
Black populations.
It is also possible that residential segregation as measured at
the ZIP code level, and the consequences from it, led to longlasting effects on health that made minority communities particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Link and Phelan (1995) argue
that social factors are a fundamental cause of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple
disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and
consequently maintain an association with disease even when
intervening mechanisms change. Phelan and Link (2015) argue
that racial inequalities in health endure primarily because racism
is a fundamental cause of racial differences in socioeconomic
status, and in turn socioeconomic status is a fundamental cause
of health inequalities. Chetty et al. (2019) find Black Americans
have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of
downward mobility than Whites, leading to persistent income
disparities across generations. The Black-White gap persists even
among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Logan and
Parman (2018) demonstrate that premature mortality among
Blacks is rooted in historical segregation. Using person-level
data, the authors apply a comprehensive measure of segregation
extending the analysis of structural factors in racial health disparities. Wiemers et al. (2020) highlight disparities in potential
COVID-19 complications by constructing a vulnerability index
from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, finding that Blacks
are drastically more vulnerable than other groups among people
aged 45 and older. National estimates find that COVID-19 related hospitalizations among Blacks and Hispanics are more than
four times that of Whites (CDC, U. S. 2020b). Price-Haywood
et al. (2020) found that more than 70% of patients who were
hospitalized or died of COVID-19 were Black, compared to an
overall population representation of 31%.

Data
To analyze racial and ethnic disparities, we combine ZIP
code level data on COVID-19 outcomes from state and
local government websites with data from (1) the 2018
ACS 5-year sample, (2) the 2010 Census, (3) the
Opportunity Atlas, (4) SafeGraph mobility data, (5) health
professional shortage areas published by the Health
Resources & Services Administration, and (6) conditional
life expectancy published by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.

COVID-19 Data
From state and local websites, we gathered COVID-19 data at
the ZIP code level for six metropolitan areas: New York City,
Chicago, Atlanta, San Diego, St. Louis, and Baltimore.3 The ZIP
codes include both the city proper, and in some cases the surrounding county. Cross-sectional data was gathered from June 6,
2020, to June 9, 2020, for these localities.4 Once merged with all
other sources, the full analysis uses 436 ZIP codes, with 177 in
New York City, 58 in Chicago, 49 in Atlanta, 95 in San Diego,
21 in St. Louis, and 36 in Baltimore. Overall, there are approximately 17.7 million people living in these ZIP codes, with nearly
half residing in New York City.
Our primary outcome variable is confirmed COVID-19
cases per 10,000 population. Although serological surveys
provide strong evidence that confirmed cases are an undercount of total infections, confirmed case numbers still have
clear clinical and economic significance. Nationally, the fatality and hospitalization rates for confirmed cases were roughly
5% and 10%, respectively, by June 2020.5 Even after discharge from a hospital, persistent symptoms may remain
(Carfì et al. 2020). In addition, confirmed infections (which
tend to be more severe that those that remain undetected)
undoubtedly lead to lost earnings, family strain, psychological
distress, and potentially harmful long-term consequences
(Eisenberg et al. Forthcoming). Kniesner and Sullivan
(Forthcoming) estimate economic losses from COVID-19 at
$46,000 per non-fatal case, by applying value per statistical

The ZIP code data encompass different geographies, based on what data
were available at the time. For New York City, the data covered all of the
city’s 177 ZIP codes across all five boroughs. For Chicago, the data included
all 60 ZIP codes in the city proper, but not other parts of Cook County or
DuPage County. For Atlanta, there were 59 ZIP codes within Fulton County;
the data did not include the DeKalb county portion of the city or the portions of
Fulton county outside the city limits. For San Diego, there were 100 ZIP codes
across all of San Diego County. For St. Louis, the data included all 22 ZIP
codes in St. Louis City, but not the surrounding St. Louis County. For
Baltimore, there were initially 40 ZIP codes covering parts of Baltimore
City, Baltimore County, and Anne Arundel County.

Chicago, Baltimore, and Atlanta archive their COVID-19 reports, while the
other cities (New York, San Diego, and St. Louis) only retain current data.

life and relative severity/injury estimates from the Department
of Transportation.
All six localities provided counts of COVID-19 cases,
which are scaled into counts per 10,000 population. When
weighted by population, Table 1 shows the median ZIP code
had 143 cumulative cases per 10,000 population by early
June, translating into a cumulative measured infection rate of
about 1.4%. Measured infection rates varied substantially,
with 12 cases per 10,000 (0.1%) in the lowest decile and
315 cases per 10,000 (3.2%) in the highest decile. In the aggregate, New York City had the highest rate of confirmed
cases (2.3%), followed by Chicago (1.7%) and Baltimore
(0.9%). The other three localities had confirmed case rates
varying from 0.26 to 0.48%. In the aggregate, there were more
than 271,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in these 6 cities,
approximately 14% of all cases nationally by that point.6
We also conduct auxiliary analyses using a subsample of
only Chicago and New York City, cities that provide additional data that allow us to investigate two important issues. First,
do observed disparities in confirmed COVID-19 cases accurately reflect disparities in illnesses, or are they confounded by
geographic variation in availability of tests and criteria for
obtaining them? Note that we will include city fixed effects
in all our models, which alleviates this concern to some extent.
Nonetheless, since Chicago and New York City report tests
run by ZIP code, they enable us to control for testing more
directly. Second, are racial and ethnic disparities in COVID19 fatalities the result of a higher likelihood of catching the
virus, a greater risk of dying conditional on catching it, or
some combination of both? Answering this question requires
data on COVID-19 fatalities—not just cases—and Chicago
and New York City are the only cities in our sample that report
deaths by ZIP code. The bottom panel of Table 1 shows data
for those two cities (and 235 ZIP codes). In these cities, the
cumulative fatality rate from COVID-19 was 0.17% by early
June.

Census Bureau Data
We merged this information to the 2018 ACS 5-year sample,
as well as to the 2010 Decennial Census using Social Explorer
(which provides summary statistics at the ZIP code level).7
The ACS contains a rich set of variables on demographics,
economic outcomes, and housing characteristics.
Demographic variables include percent male, percent foreign
born, and percent aged 18–44, 45–64, 65–74, and 75+ (children under 18 are omitted). Housing variables include density,
percent renters, percent vacant units, percent overcrowded

Top panel includes all 6 cities; bottom panel includes only Chicago and

and June 9, 2020. Race/ethnicity variables obtained from 2018 ACS 5year sample

(1.5 or more persons per bedroom), and percent of units with
0 or 1 bedrooms. The 2010 Census—although dated—provides information about group quarters, specifically percent
of population in nursing homes, correctional facilities, college
dormitories, and military barracks. Returning to the ACS 5year sample, our socioeconomic variables include percent in
education bins (dropout, high school, some college, bachelor’s degree, the group beyond a bachelor’s degree is omitted
as a reference category), income inequality as measured by the
Gini coefficient, and percent in poverty bins (0–49% FPL, 50–
74%, 75–99%, 100–149%, 150–199%, 200%+ is omitted).
Occupation variables include percent of workers in service
occupations, sales, farming, construction, production, or transport (managerial occupations omitted). Transportation variables include percent of workers of workers who use a car,
percent who use public transportation, and percent with long
commuting times (60+ min). Finally, one of our measures of
health access—percent without health insurance—comes
from the ACS.

Opportunity Atlas Data
The Opportunity Atlas is a collaboration of the Census Bureau,
Harvard University, and Brown University that uses anonymous
data following 20 million Americans from childhood to their
mid-30s, with many outcomes measured at the Census Tract
level (which we aggregate up to ZIP code).8 As noted by
Chetty et al. (2018), neighborhoods matter at a very granular
level, where neighborhoods even one mile away have very little
predictive power for child outcomes. We focus on two key variables, which represent long-run opportunity. The first is average
annual household income ranking in 2014–2015 for children (in
their mid-30s) who grew up in the area, based on having a lowincome parent (25th percentile). The second is fraction of male
children who grew up in the area who were in prison or jail on
April 1, 2010. We aggregate Census Tracts to the ZIP code level
using a crosswalk provided by the Missouri Census Data
Center.9 We follow the spirit of Courtemanche et al. (2017) by
assigning Census Tract to the ZIP code where the plurality of
residents live. In practice, approximately 53% of Tracts nationally map into one ZIP code only, and roughly 75% of Tracts have
at least 80% of their population in one ZIP code.

SafeGraph Data
Many recent COVID-19 studies examine mobility using data
from SafeGraph, which provides access to their data through
free, non-commercial agreements.10 Following Gupta et al.
(2020), we compute the fraction of cell phone devices that
were detected to be entirely at home during the day, aggregating from the Census Block Group level to the ZIP code level.
We aggregate Census Block Groups to ZIP codes using a
crosswalk provided by the Missouri Census Data Center.
We computed daily averages for each ZIP code, and then
averaged across all days for the months of March 2020,
April 2020, and May 2020. Again, following Courtemanche
et al. (2017), we assign Census Block Groups to the ZIP code
where the plurality of residents live. In practice, approximately 73% of Census Block Groups nationally map into one ZIP
code only, and roughly 85% of Tracts have at least 80% of
their population in one ZIP code.

Health Professional Shortage Area Data
We incorporate information on each ZIP code’s status as being designated as a health professional shortage area (HPSA)
for federal fiscal year 2020.11 HPSAs are designated by the

Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to
signify areas as medically underserved. The Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide HPSA designation status at the ZIP code level to signal to eligible health
care professionals (e.g., physicians) if the location where they
practice medical care is eligible for enhanced Medicare reimbursements per the 2005 Medicare Modernization Act (CMS,
U.S. Centers for Medicare, and Medicaid Services 2020). This
feature of the program creates a financial incentive for delivering care in medically underserved settings with historically
higher uninsured rates and limited access to care. We use this
as a proxy measure to capture differences in access to primary
care and mental health services. HPSAs can be entire counties,
but are most commonly smaller portions of a county—this is
particularly the case in larger cities.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Data
Our population health variables are conditional life expectancies obtained from the U.S. Small-area Life Expectancy
Estimates Project (USALEEP).12 The files contain conditional
life expectancies for different age bins at the Census Tract
level; in our model, we include conditional life expectancies
for ages 65–74, 75–84, and 85 plus, and aggregate from the
Tract level to ZIP code. Many commentators attribute disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths to underlying health conditions such as elevated rates of chronic illnesses among
Blacks and Latinos (Artiga et al. 2020). We use variation in
life expectancy—and focus on the elderly who are most vulnerable to COVID-19—to control for variation in underlying
health status as well as the risk factors leading to differences in
preventable mortality.
Table 2 shows, along some margins, large differences in
neighborhood characteristics depending on racial and ethnic
composition. Out of the 436 ZIP codes, 188 are majority
White, 84 are majority Black, 49 are majority Hispanic, and
115 are none of these. With respect to demographics, Hispanic
neighborhoods have much higher representation of foreignborn individuals. With respect to housing, there are more
renters in majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods. Lower educational attainment and higher poverty
levels are also common attributes of these neighborhoods, as
are lower levels of income mobility—an indicator of long-run
opportunity. At least some types of workers whose jobs do not
easily transfer online—those in service occupations—are
more prevalent in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Also common in predominantly Black and
Hispanic neighborhoods are larger dependence on public transit as a key mode of transportation (McLaren 2020) and longer
commuting times. Cell phone mobility measures are relatively
similar, on average, across neighborhoods. Health care access

is worse for Black and Hispanic neighborhoods according to
both percent uninsured and mental health HPSA, while population health—proxied by conditional life expectancy—is
fairly similar across neighborhood types, especially from age
75 onward. Finally, racial composition and segregation varies
by city. None of the ZIP codes in San Diego are majority
Black, while Atlanta, Baltimore, and St. Louis have no ZIP
codes that are majority Hispanic.

Empirical Model and Findings
Model
We estimate linear models of the following form:
covidz; j ¼ β0 þ β 1 PCT BLACKz; j
þ β2 PCT HISPANICz; j þ β 3 OTHERz; j
þ β4 X z; j þ δ j þ εz; j

ð1Þ

where covidz, j represents either confirmed COVID-19 cases
per 10,000 population or COVID-19 fatalities per 1,000,000
population in ZIP code z in city j. The key explanatory variables include the percentage Black and percentage Hispanic in
each ZIP code (we also include percentage other race, with
percentage White omitted).13 We successively include additional neighborhood characteristics in Xz, j. City fixed effects

In the subsequent tables, we focus attention on percent black and percent
Hispanic. The other race category includes several groups, some of which are
not traditionally disadvantaged. Appendix Table 8 shows all the coefficients
from our base model and full model.

are given by δj and εz, j is the error term. All observations are
weighted by population in the ZIP code. Standard errors are
heteroscedasticity-robust.14
Any observational analysis like this identifies correlations,
not causation (Knittel and Ozaltun 2020). With many observable neighborhood differences—including some characteristics that intuitively might represent greater likelihood of
COVID-19 transmission such as density, occupations, modes
of transport, or health care access—it may be tempting to
attach causal stories. However, these variables could influence
each other or be influenced by unobservable characteristics of
the ZIP code, preventing causal inference. Our principal goal,
therefore, is simply to assess the extent to which such measured characteristics can collectively explain the racial and
ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden, and the extent to
which these disparities remain unexplained by conventional
measures.
Our model’s city fixed effects account for some potential
confounders, such the arrival of the virus, weather patterns,
and lockdown policies, but not unobserved heterogeneity at
the sub-city level. A number of recent studies control for unobserved heterogeneity at granular levels (Schuetz et al. 2008;
Price 2013), recognizing that micro-geographies are an important determinant of individual health outcomes (Arcaya et al.
2016). It is not possible to include ZIP code fixed effects (or
14
We also ran regressions clustering the standard errors at the city level, and
this made the standard errors implausibly small in some cases. Since the
number of clusters (6) is too small for cluster-robust inference to be reliable,
we err on the side of caution and report the (larger) standard errors obtained
without clustering. Also note that, since we do not include any city-level
variables, there is no particular reason to think that standard errors obtained
without clustering are systematically flawed (Cameron and Miller 2015).

fixed effects at a narrower level such as Census Tract) in our
models because they would be perfectly collinear with the ZIP
code-level covariates such as race and ethnicity.15

Size of Disparities
Our primary results are presented in Table 3, which examines
confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 population. In the
top panel, we examine 436 ZIP codes across the 6 cities, and
successively include covariates for demographics, housing,
socioeconomic status, opportunity, occupation, transportation, human mobility, health access, and population health.
The base model in column (1)—which only includes the
race/ethnicity variables, city fixed effects, and a constant
term—shows large, highly significant health disparities for
both Blacks and Hispanics. A 10 percentage point increase
in a ZIP code’s Black share is associated with to 9.2 additional
confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population, while a
similar change in the Hispanic share is associated with 20.6
additional COVID-19 cases. Both are very sizable changes
relative to the average confirmed cases rate of 153 per
10,000 population.
As the analysis moves from one column to the next, sets of
covariates are successively included. For example, including
“demographics” in column (2) adds six additional variables
for percent male, percent foreign, and percent in each of four
age bins to the specification. Across the remaining columns,
the measured disparity remains sizable and significant, regardless of the set of controls that are included. The full model in
column (10) shows disparities that are roughly 60% as large as
in column (1). Thus, a key insight is that even with an extensive set of controls for factors that should plausibly affect the
transmission of the virus, more than half of the overall disparity in confirmed COVID-19 cases remains unexplained.
In the bottom panel, we focus on the 235 ZIP codes in
Chicago and New York, since those localities provide additional data on COVID-19. The initial overall disparities in
column (1) are larger, and a 10 percentage point increase in
a ZIP code’s Black share is associated with 12.4 additional
confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population, while a
similar change in the Hispanic share is associated with to 24.8

15

We considered controlling for geography with Census Public Use
Microdata Area (“PUMA”) fixed effects instead of city fixed effects.
PUMAs are geographically contiguous areas of at least 100,000 people; our
436 ZIP codes across the 6 cities map into 130 PUMAs. PUMA fixed effects
are intuitively appealing since they avoid perfect collinearity while capturing
unobserved heterogeneity at a much more detailed geographic level than the
city. Unfortunately, in practice, PUMA lines often coincide with racial and
ethnic divides of a city, and there is insufficient within-PUMA variation to
credibly estimate disparities. Specifically, PUMA fixed effects and the ZIP
code-level controls explain over 97% of the variation in a ZIP code’s percent
Black and Hispanic, which is far beyond typical rules of thumb for severe
multicollinearity.

J Econ Race Policy (2020) 3:243–261

additional COVID-19 cases. Again, both are sizable changes
relative to the average confirmed cases rate of 219 per 10,000
population for these two cities. As neighborhood characteristics are added in the remaining columns, in some instances,
the disparity falls and in others it rises. With the full set of
controls in column (10), there remain sizable disparities for
both Blacks and Hispanics, and again more than half of the
overall disparity remains unexplained. It should be noted that
the “health access” variables in column (9) now include
COVID-19 tests per capita at the ZIP code level.
Next, we turn to Table 4, where we examine COVID-19
fatalities at the ZIP code level for Chicago and New York, an
outcome that was a key focus in McLaren (2020) and Knittel
and Ozaltun (2020). To maintain comparability, we scale
COVID-19 fatalities per million population. In column (1),
we estimate models with race/ethnicity controls, city fixed
effects, and a constant term, finding large and statistically
significant disparities. A 10 percentage point increase in the
Black (Hispanic) share is associated with to 143 (149) additional fatalities per million, from a baseline of 1727 per million in these two cities. In column (2), we include as an additional control COVID-19 cases (per 10,000) in each ZIP code.
Thus, we ask the extent to which variation in fatalities is simply explained by greater numbers of confirmed COVID-19
cases, versus the extent to which factors beyond additional
cases matter. The results show that the coefficients fall by
50–100%, suggesting that racial and ethnic disparities in the
spread of infection are an extremely important determinant for
resultant fatalities. For proportion Hispanic, the coefficient
estimate is very close to zero, while for proportion Black,
the coefficient estimate is about half as large. In columns (3)
and onward, additional covariates similar to the ones in the
bottom panel of Table 3 are added. With sufficient controls,
the original racial and ethnic disparities become insignificant.

Mechanisms
In a highly cited paper, Gelbach (2016) shows that the sequence in which covariates are entered into the model can lead
to very different conclusions about their relative importance.
In our context, the extent to which different sets of neighborhood characteristics “explain” the observed racial and ethnic
disparities may be sensitive to the sequence in which they are
entered into the model. For example, the changes in racial and
ethnic disparities from adding demographic covariates may
have been different than those shown in Tables 3 and 4 if
we had added housing variables first, since demographic and
housing variables are correlated. In order to create a pathindependent explanation of the influence of each set of neighborhood characteristics, Gelbach prescribes omitted variable
bias equations. Essentially, we estimate omitted variable bias
on the coefficient of interest from the exclusion of each sets of
neighborhood controls one at a time from the full model (in

Table 3, column 10). The influence of each set of neighborhood characteristics therefore becomes a function of the correlation between the covariate and race/ethnicity in addition to
the covariate’s coefficient in the full specification.
Table 5 shows the results of the Gelbach decomposition for
our full set of 6 cities on COVID-19 cases (Table 3, top panel), as
well for the 2 cities on cases and fatalities (Table 3, bottom panel;
Table 4).16 The baseline coefficient comes from the model that
only includes racial/ethnic composition, city fixed effects, and a
constant term. The “explained difference” is the reduction that
occurs from moving from the first column to the last column
(e.g., from 0.92 to 0.59 for “% Black” in the top panel of
Table 3), and the remaining rows show the contribution of each
set of neighborhood characteristics to the explained reduction (as

well as their statistical significance). In the model of COVID-19
cases with all 6 cities in column (1), much of the explained
difference in the disparity for Blacks can be attributed to the long
run opportunity variables (income mobility and male incarceration rates for those born between 1978 and 1983). Although other
sets of neighborhood characteristics occasionally have large
magnitudes (e.g., the occupation controls), they are not statistically significant. For the Hispanic disparity, the opportunity variables again contribute to part of the explained difference; however, demographics (which includes the fraction foreign born)
and human mobility (from SafeGraph) are larger factors.
The findings, when restricted to Chicago and New York,
are somewhat different in for cases and fatalities (columns 2
and 3 of Table 5, respectively). For confirmed COVID-19
cases, the combined addition of all the covariates does little
to change the estimate for proportion Black; however, several

All specifications include city fixed effects, “% Other non-white”, and a constant term. Unit of observation is ZIP code. Demographic variables include
percentage in ZIP code who are male, foreign born, or in age bins (18–44, 45–64, 65–74, 75+). Housing variables include density, percentage who are
renters, percent of units vacant, percentage who are in nursing homes, correctional facilities, college dorms, or military barracks (2010 Census), percent
overcrowded (1.5+ per room), and percent with 0 or 1 bedroom sizes. Socioeconomic variables include percent in education bins (dropout, high school,
some college, bachelor’s degree), Gini coefficient, and percent in poverty bins (0–49% FPL, 50–74%, 75–99%, 100–149%, 150–199%). Opportunity
Atlas variables include income mobility and male incarceration (Opportunity Atlas). Occupation variables include percent of workers in service
occupations, sales, farming, construction, production, or transport. Transportation variables include percent of workers of workers who use a car,
percent who use public transportation, and percent with long commuting times (60+ minutes). Safegraph variables include percent who on average
remained at home all day in each month from March to May 2020 (Safegraph). Health access variables include health professional shortage areas
(HRSA; mental health, primary care), percent without health insurance, and COVID-19 tests per capita (Chicago and New York City only). Population
health variables include conditional life expectancy (CDC, ages 65–74, 75–84, 85+). All control variables obtained from 2018 ACS 5-year sample

factors offset each other to result in essentially the zero
change. Controlling for health care access and human mobility
is associated with statistically significant reductions in the
disparity, but this is offset by statistically significant increases
in the disparity from housing and socioeconomic characteristics and insignificant but similarly sized increases from occupation and transportation. For proportion Hispanic, the key
driver explaining much of the reduction in confirmed cases
appears to be health care access, which in the context of the
two cities includes COVID-19 tests per capita.17
Finally, for COVID-19 fatalities (column 3 of Table 5),
adding covariates from the base model to the full model entirely explains the disparities for proportion Black and
Hispanic. The most important factor in explaining COVID19 fatalities is simply the rate of infection. Differences in
confirmed cases explain approximately two-thirds of the disparity in fatalities for Blacks, and the entire disparity for
Hispanics. Other factors appear to have large and somewhat
17

Appendix Table 8 shows that among health access variables for New York
and Chicago, tests per capita is highly significant for confirmed cases.

offsetting effects for both groups (e.g., socioeconomic controls and occupational controls), but a key implication is that
understanding the core causes of COVID-19 cases can potentially explain the alarming subsequent differences in mortality.

Robustness Checks
We explore several robustness checks in Tables 6 and 7. As
illustrated in Table 2, one key advantage of analyzing ZIP codes
rather than counties is that residential segregation is much more
stark. Overall, 327 of the 436 ZIP codes are highly segregated,
and we re-estimate the models of COVID-19 cases restricted to
neighborhoods that are the majority of one race or ethnicity in the
top panel of Table 6. Overall, the findings—both from the base
model and full model—are very similar to Table 3. Next, we test
the sensitivity of the results to excluding one city at a time in
Table 7, presenting findings from the base specification and full
specification. In all cases, there are sizable racial and ethnic disparities in the base specification. The findings on Hispanic disparities are robust across all specifications; there are large disparities that are partially explained by neighborhood characteristics.

Table 3.

Conclusion
In this study, we use ZIP code level data to understand the factors
contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden.
We find strong evidence that predominantly Black and Hispanic
neighborhoods were disproportionately at risk to COVID-19 infections and mortality—although the disparities were larger
among Hispanic neighborhoods. Even though our study was
limited to six cities, these cities include the first (New York)
and third (Chicago) largest in the USA, and case counts from
these cities accounted for 14% of all confirmed US cases through
June 9, 2020. The ZIP code level data allow us to examine a
much wider range of variation in racial and ethnic composition
than other studies using county-level data, and we also contribute

to the literature by exploring numerous possible explanations for
the disparities using decomposition methods. Differences in social mobility, demographics, and long-run opportunity arose as
important contributors to COVID-related disparities. However, a
significant share of the disparity in cases for Blacks and
Hispanics remains unexplained despite the inclusion of an exhaustive list of covariates. For fatalities, the majority of the disparities appear to be driven by the differences in cases, as opposed to differential case fatality rates. This is an important result,
as it implies that interventions targeting reducing the spread of
the virus in minority communities might be a more effective use
of scarce resources than those targeting health care utilization
once infected.
Our inability to explain most of the disparities in COVID-19
spread is perhaps surprising since we control for the risk factors
largely associated with social deprivation. Recent studies have
used area deprivation indexes (ADI) to explain disparities in
avoidable hospitalizations and readmissions (Kind and
Buckingham 2018; Jencks et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2018) and

difficulty managing chronic illnesses (Kurani et al. 2020; Zhang
et al. 2020; Camacho et al. 2017; Durfey et al. 2019). ADIs are
composite measures generally made up of weighted combinations of education, labor market composition, income, income
inequality, and housing market information such as home ownership (Singh 2003). Rather than use an ADI, we allow for each
of our key covariates to enter into the regression separately,
which is theoretically more flexible and should allow for greater
explanatory power.
With that said, if our lengthy list of explanatory variables
does not explain the disparities in COVID-19 cases, then what
does? Are we not more successful in explaining the disparities
because we are considering the wrong theories, or because
available data are inadequate to fully test the existing theories?
Structural racism may influence multiple mechanisms that are
difficult to quantify (Poteat et al. 2020; Braveman and
Gottlieb 2014). For example, racial biases could influence
clinical decision making, which would not be captured by
crude access measures such as uninsured rates (Jones 2001).
Obermeyer et al. (2019) found that several clinical decisionsupport algorithms were less likely to refer Black patients for
advanced care and screening than White patients presenting

with identical symptoms. With respect to the COVID pandemic, there are reports of Blacks being denied screenings
after seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms at the early stages
of this pandemic (Gathright 2020; Samuels 2020; Shamus
2020; Patton 2020; Mitropoulos and Moseley 2020).
Additionally, perhaps conditional life expectancies are inadequate measures of underlying health risks. The premature
deaths linked to COVID-19 complications are associated with
poorer underlying health status and whether the person had a
pre-existing condition such as diabetes, obesity, or hypertension, and we are unable to measure those directly.18 As another example, available socioeconomic information may not truly capture the source of disadvantage; percent with a high
school or college degree says little about the quality of the
schools attended, for instance.

18
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has several state and national level tools to monitor chronic diseases such as the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS), but the only publicly available resource at the county-level
we are aware of is the U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System, and we are not
aware of any at a narrower level than county.

To call the COVID-19 pandemic “the Great Equalizer” is a
misnomer (Mein 2020; Kim et al. 2020), and the pandemic’s key
risk factors are unevenly distributed across communities. Even
though we are able to explain some of the racial and ethnic
disparities as attributable to different concentrations of socioeconomic risk factors, the fact that most of the case disparities remains unexplained demonstrates the difficulty of addressing
deeply embedded racial and ethnic inequalities in health outcomes. Although more study is needed, our results suggest that
policies enacted to curb COVID-19’s spread should consider
how they would overcome the structural barriers to improvement
across different groups. More superficial interventions such as
economic stimulus or expanding health insurance coverage are
unlikely to be fully adequate.
