COVID-19 and the Demand for Online Food Shopping Services: Empirical Evidence from
Taiwan

NBER Working Paper No. 27427
June 2020
JEL No. I10,Q13
ABSTRACT
We investigate how the coronavirus pandemic affected the demand for online food shopping
services using data from the largest agri-food e-commerce platform in Taiwan. We find that an
additional confirmed case of COVID-19 increased sales by 5.7% and the number of customers by
4.9%. The demand for grains, fresh fruit and vegetables, and frozen foods increased the most,
which benefited small farms over agribusinesses. Online food shopping was highly responsive to
COVID-19 media coverage and online content. Because Taiwan did not impose a stay-at-home
order, the demand for online food shopping may be similar in other countries after they lift
mobility restrictions.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented
challenges for the agri-food industry. After public health officials across the globe
recommended social distancing and governments implemented stay-at-home orders
and travel restrictions, retail food establishments and farmers experienced both
demand and supply shocks (WHO 2020; The World Bank 2020). Due to widespread
prohibitions on dining inside restaurants, demand for restaurant food has decreased
dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic, and restaurants unable to offer takeout services have closed (Mohammed 2020). The resulting shift in demand away from
food eaten away from home (FAFH) towards the food purchased at supermarkets,
grocery stores and convenience stores has resulted in shortages and declining
inventory levels of some food products (Uhler 2020). In the U.S., for example, just
over half of food expenditures prior to the pandemic where for FAFH (Saksena et al.
2018). With FAFH options limited to take-out in much of the U.S., grocery and
beverage store sales increased more than 25% in March 2020 (Redman 2020a).
Likewise, March grocery store sales increased by 20% in the U.K., setting a fourweek sales record (Mattinson 2020).
COVID-19 has also caused disruptions to the agri-food supply chain that have
exacerbated difficulties in bringing food to market in sufficient quantity to meet
surging demand. One significant short-term difficulty has been shifting agricultural
products from restaurants to a retail food sector that has different storage capacity and
transportation infrastructure (Hart et al. 2020; Hobbs 2020). Keeping food processing
plants operational while maintaining adequate protection for employees has also been
a major challenge, and the spread of the coronavirus at some facilities has caused
them to close (Hailu 2020; Gallagher and Kirkland 2020). Numerous media outlets
report similar difficulties at food warehouses and shipping companies (Newton 2020;
Narayan 2020; Davis 2020). International shipping of commodities across national
borders has also slowed due to reductions in demand for manufactured goods that
have limited capacity for reciprocal trade in agricultural products (Gray 2020; King
2020). Additional inspections and food safety investigations at national borders also
slow agricultural trade in both directions, and international travel restrictions stand to
limit seasonal farm labor migration during upcoming harvests (Hobbs 2020; Hooper
and Le Coz 2020).
Despite the difficulties experienced by food shoppers due to COVID-19, such as
limited public transportation, food stockouts (i.e. exhausted inventories), and reduced
hours at supermarkets and grocery stores, most shoppers in developed countries such

1

as the U.S. have maintained adequate access to food (U.S. FDA 2020). 1 This is in no
small part due to the availability of online e-commerce platforms that allow
consumers to shop for food over the internet and have it either delivered to their
home, or set aside for curbside pick-up. Prior to the pandemic, online food shopping
was gaining popularity in many countries, but travel restrictions and the fear of
infection have quickly led consumers to choose online shopping as their preferred
means of purchasing food (Singh 2019; Debter 2020). As a consequence, online
grocery sales in the U.S. are projected to grow 40% in 2020, and e-commerce sales at
Walmart increased 74% in April 2020 despite a drop in foot traffic at stores (Redman
2020b; Nassauer 2020a). Likewise, e-commerce sales at U.S. Target stores rose 141%
in each month of the first quarter of 2020 while comparable in-store sales increased
less than 1% (Nassauer 2020b). Online food shopping in China and Europe has also
increased significantly since the start of the pandemic (Cheng 2020; von Abrams
2020). In many cases, nascent e-commerce platforms have had difficulty
accommodating the surge in online customers, leading to long processing and delivery
wait times for consumers (Gray 2020; Debter 2020).
By allowing consumers to obtain food from home, it is very likely that online food
shopping has helped to slow the transmission of the coronavirus and protect at-risk
consumers with pre-existing conditions. E-commerce platforms may both provide
customers with convenient options and generate positive externalities in the form of
lower infection rates and reduced health care costs. It is therefore important to
understand what drives the use of online food shopping services. In this paper, we
analyze several critical aspects of consumers’ online food shopping decisions using
transaction data from the largest online platform selling agri-food products in Taiwan.
First, we measure how online shopping responds to the number of COVID-19 cases in
an individual’s local area. In doing so, we consider not only how case counts affect
financial measures of the e-commerce platform, but also what types of foods
consumers purchase and which suppliers benefit the most from the increase in
demand brought about by the pandemic.
Since there may be a delay between the growth in infections and consumer
awareness of infection rates in their local area, we next measure how the use of online
shopping responds to a measure of internet searches about the coronavirus. Last, we
consider how the focus of news media on COVID-19 affects consumer participation
in online food shopping. Past research suggests that news articles may both reflect
consumers’ sentiment and shape opinions (Zucker 1978; Happer and Philo 2013;
1

Due to limited availability of fresh fruits and vegetables, some consumers in developed countries
have shifted to pre-prepared foods that are less health (Wunsch 2020; Miriri and Hunt 2020). In
developing countries where food shortages are more acute, the potential exists for more serious and
widespread malnutrition (Dahir 2020; World Food Program USA 2020).

2

Hopkins, Kim and Kim 2017). By analyzing both the effect of actual COVID-19 case
counts and news coverage of the pandemic we can infer whether consumers’ response
to news media is consistent with their response to the actual number of COVID-19
cases in their community.
The online food shopping industry is in a unique stage of its development. Prior
to the coronavirus pandemic the use of online shopping was increasing at a steady
state as platforms became more user-friendly. While some projected that online food
shopping would soon challenge a dominant retail food industry, online purchases were
typically less than 5% of total sales (Redman 2020b; IGD 2017; Nielsen 2015). As the
first paper to investigate the demand for online food shopping services during the
COVID-19 period, we provide evidence of how COVID-19 has caused a shift in the
mode of food delivery that could ultimately lead to a realignment of the retail food
sector.
2. COVID-19 and agri-food e-commerce in Taiwan
Because Taiwan is only 81 miles from mainland China, and there is steady travel
between the two countries 2, the number of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan was expected
to be high (Wang, Ng and Brook 2020). Despite such inherent risk, Taiwan’s
confirmed case count and the case-fatality rate is relatively low (JHU CSSE 2020).
Following the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Taiwan on January 21, 2020, the
government initiated a coordinated response involving central disease surveillance,
border control policies, and contact tracing that largely contained the virus. Although
Taiwan has had ongoing success with disease control, anxiety over the spread of
COVID-19 was high at the beginning of the outbreak (Wang, Ng and Brook 2020).
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the agri-food e-commerce industry in Taiwan
was growing steadily but still much smaller than the traditional retail sector. By 2016,
online sales of food reached NT $15 billion (Liu, 2016). In addition, Taiwan’s
Council of Agriculture sponsored training programs for farmers in key areas such as
internet marketing and e-commerce business models in order to promote farm-toconsumer internet sales. The programs, in conjunction with the Taiwan Agriculture
and Food Traceability System3, help organic and small producers become more
competitive by bypassing wholesalers and highlighting the origin or healthfulness of
products (Taiwan Today 2016).

2

For example, there were over 2.7 million visitors to Taiwan from China in 2019 (Wang and Lin
2020).
3
The Taiwan Agriculture and Food Traceability System, established in 2007, provides consumers with
information on the origin agricultural produce and ingredients.

3. Data
We used data from several sources to conduct our analysis, including administrative
sales records from a large agri-food e-commerce platform, information about
coronavirus cases in Taiwan, search data from Google, and data on COVID-19 news
articles from Taiwan’s largest newspapers.
3.1. Administrative sales records from the Ubox platform
We created several measures of online food shopping using data from the
administrative transaction records of Ubox 4, the largest business-to-consumer agrifood e-commerce platform in Taiwan. Ubox is a non-profit corporation established in
1999 by the Council of Agriculture to sell food from agricultural business
cooperatives and individual farms directly to consumers. Prior to the advent of Ubox,
other e-commerce platforms rarely offered agri-food products due to their perishable
nature. Although Taiwan’s farm associations initially sponsored Ubox, the platform
does not restrict the source of its products. Ubox delivers food ordered on its platform
directly to a consumer’s home through an express delivery shipping service. Similar
to other e-commerce platforms, Ubox’s revenue is derived from a 10-15% charge
applied to the sales value of each transaction (Wu 2017).
Transaction records from Ubox include the amount of each food product sold to
consumers and the associated expenditure at the individual transaction-level. The
records also contain the date of the transaction and the purchaser’s zip code, allowing
us to aggregate sales data to the county level for each week. 5 In addition to sales
transactions, the data contain the payments received by each seller and the profit made
on the platform from each transaction. We can identify whether a seller is a member
of one of the following three categories: farmer association/marketing cooperative,
agribusiness cooperative and individual farm. The data also contain the following six
product identifiers: frozen food, fresh fruit or vegetables, whole grains, non-alcoholic
drinks, other types of food products and non-food products. By aggregating individual
transactions within these product categories, we created a panel dataset at the product
category-county-week level.
Since Taiwan confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on January 21, 2020, we
constructed a treated sample using Ubox transactions over the 11-week period from
January 21, 2020 to April 6, 2020. 6 We then constructed a control sample using Ubox
transactions from 2017, 2018, and 2019 that occurred during the same week range.
There are 2,686 observations in both samples combined. We don’t include
4

https://www.ubox.org.tw/
There are 21 counties in Taiwan. The average size of each county is 1,723 square kilometers.
There were between 6,522 and 13,427 transactions during the 11-week periods in 2017 - 2020.

4

transactions that occurred in the weeks just prior to January 21, 2020 in our control
sample because both the demand for many food products and their supply is seasonal,
and we believe it is more appropriate to have the control sample during the same
season as our treated sample.
We created several variables at the product category-county-week level that we
used as dependent variables in our empirical models. These include total sales, total
payments received by producers, total Ubox profits, the number of consumers that
used the platform, the number of producers who sold products on the platform, and a
product variety index. Following Chu and Manchanda (2016), we constructed the
𝑁𝑁
2
latter as: 𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 = 1 − 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑝𝑝 = 1 − ∑𝑖𝑖=1
𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
, where 𝑝𝑝 indicates product category and

𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁𝑁 indexes individual products within a given product category. HHI is the
Herfindahl-Hirschman index, which we calculated from the squared shares of the
quantity of individual products sold within each product category. The HHI ranges
between 0 and 1, where a value of 1 indicates that only 1 item was sold in the product
category, and the value of 0 is achieved when the number of items sold in the product
category becomes infinitely large. Therefore, higher values of 𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 indicate greater
diversity in the number of individual foods sold within a product category.
The control variables we constructed from the Ubox records include six variables
that indicate product category and three variables that capture the product seller. The
latter are the ratios of products sold by farmer associations/marketing cooperatives,
agribusinesses, or individual farms in each product category in every county during
each week.

3.2. COVID-19 case counts
From the Center of Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan, we obtained the number of
confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in each county and week between
January 21, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Confirmed cases were validated by a COVD-19
test, while suspected cases are non-confirmed cases that were reported to the CDC
because the healthcare provider felt that the patient exhibited symptoms consistent
with a COVID-19 infection. Only confirmed cases are reported to the public during
CDC press conferences. We created measures of the weekly number of confirmed and
total cases and the cumulative number of confirmed and total cases and merged the
associated variables to the UBox data by county identification number and week.
Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of cumulative confirmed COVID-19
cases in Taiwan, as of April 6, 2020 at the county level. There is a clear correlation
between case counts and population density, with the largest number of cases
concentrated in Taipei and the western part of the island.
5

3.3. COVID-19 web searches and newspaper articles
While case count data allows us to track the spread of the virus across counties
and time, they don’t perfectly correlate to consumer information about the spread of
COVID-19. This is because there can be a delay between when case counts are
reported and when consumers learn about the infection rate in their local area. In
order to better measure consumer receipt of information about the virus we obtained
two variables that measure web search activity on Google.com from the Google
Trends data. 7 Using these data one can extract index values that measure the
popularity of web searches for particular terms in a given location across time. We
extracted one index that measures the popularity of web searches for “COVID-19” or
“Coronavirus” during each week of our treatment period across Taiwan. The second
index is based on the number of new article searches for these same terms during the
treatment period.
Web searches provide one measure of information seeking by consumers, but
many consumers access information on a regular basis without the aid of the internet.
This is particularly true of older consumers. In order to better measure the availability
of information about COVID-19 we aggregated the number of times during each
week of the treatment period that the text “COVID-19” or “Coronavirus” appeared in
each of Taiwan’s five largest newspapers. This last variable provides a measure of
media influence on the intensity of online food shopping. We merged all three
variables to the Ubox data using week identifiers in year 2020.
3.4. Descriptive statistics
In Table 1 we report week-by-week changes in the number of confirmed COVID19 infections and the number of total (confirmed and suspected) COVID-19 cases for
the 11-week period following the first confirmed case on January 21, 2020.
Confirmed cases never exceed 2% of total cases in any week of the sample period.
Weekly confirmed cases peek at 129 in the 9th week following the initial infection at
the same time that total cases are at their highest point. However, confirmed cases
continue to decline in the 11th week despite an increase in suspected cases over the
10th week. During the 11th week cumulative cases were only 372, or 15.6 per million.
In comparison, confirmed cases in the U.S. 11 weeks after the first known case were
634 per million. 8
Table 1 also contains the weekly index values measuring Google keyword

This calculation is based on the daily COVID-19 case counts provided by the CDC
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), and the projected 2020
population of the U.S. from the United Nations Population Division (Available at
https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).

searches, Google news searches and newspaper mentions of COVID-19/Coronavirus.
Keyword searches initially peak in the second week following the first reported case,
decline, and peak again to their highest level in the 9th week when infections also
peak. Newspaper mentions of COVID-19 follow a similar patter, as do news searches,
although the latter are still rising in the 11th week. It is interesting that the second
surge in Google searches and newspaper mentions correlates with the weekly number
of confirmed cases, rather than the cumulative confirmed case count. This is
consistent with the contemporaneous infection rate driving consumers’ desire for
COVID-19 information, rather than past levels of infection.
We report the mean and standard deviation for all variables during the COVID-19
period and the control period in Table 2. The measures of online food shopping are
higher in the COVID-19 period than the control period, and there is a corresponding
shift in the ratio of products sold by farm cooperatives at the expense of those sold by
individual farms (the ratio business cooperative sales is unchanged). Finally, there is a
small increase in the proportion of frozen food and grain products purchased during
the COVID-19 period, and a small decrease in other food purchases.
4. Empirical Model
We used a panel data model to identify the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on
several different measures of online food shopping (Wooldridge 2010). The Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) estimating equation is:
(1)

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾 ∙ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶19𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 + 𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 + 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is one of the following the outcome variables for a Ubox transaction in

product category 𝑖𝑖 in county 𝑗𝑗 during time 𝑡𝑡: platform sales, payments to
producers, platform profits, product variety, number of customers, or number of
producers 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶19𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a continuous variable measuring one of the following in

county 𝑗𝑗 and during week 𝑡𝑡: the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the
cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the weekly number of total
(confirmed and suspected) COVID-19 cases, or the cumulative number of total
COVID-19 cases. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of explanatory variables that includes the ratio of

products sold by food cooperatives, agribusinesses and individuals farms, and
indicator variables for product category (see Table 2 for more information); 𝑡𝑡𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 and
𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 are time fixed effects for year and week, respectively; 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗 is a county-level
fixed effect; 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a random error component. The parameter γ , which measures
the impact of an additional case of COVID-19 on the outcome variable, is identified
using variation in COVID-19 cases over time within county (across both the COVID7

19 and non-COVID-19 period).
We used the same specification to estimate the effect of a 100-unit change in the
index measuring weekly COVID-19 Google web searches and news searches or the
number COVID-19/Coronavirus mentions in newspaper articles. However, in this
case the explanatory variables of interest do not vary by county. For both sets of
models, we used the two-way-cluster-robust variance approach proposed by Cameron
and Miller (2015) to cluster the standard errors of the coefficients at both the county
and week level.
5. Empirical Results
5.1. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online food shopping through Ubox
Table 3 contains our estimates of the impact of weekly and cumulative confirmed
COVID-19 cases on Ubox platform sales, payments to producers who sell their food
products on Ubox, and Ubox platform profits. Full estimation results for the platform
sales model are also reported in Appendix Table A1. An additional confirmed case of
COVID-19 during a one-week timeframe increased Ubox sales by NT$ 249 per week
(the point estimate is 0.249 in NT$1,000/week). By dividing this estimate by the mean
sales value in the non-COVID-19 period (NT$ 4,392), we find that sales increased by
5.7% due to an additional COVID-19 case. The marginal effect of one additional
confirmed case per week had a similar effect on payments to producers and platform
profits. In the case of the former, this is because Ubox charges a similar commission
to producers, irrespective of their size. Ubox platform sales, payments and profits are
all less responsive to an increase in the cumulative number of confirmed cases than a
contemporaneous increase in weekly cases. A one unit increase in the cumulative case
count increased the three measures by only 1.5% – 1.7%.
In Table 4 we report fixed effect estimates for two additional measures of online
food shopping, the number of Ubox customers and suppliers, and our measure of the
variety of food products sold on Ubox. At 4.9% and 5.0%, the effect of an additional
weekly confirmed case of COVID-19 on the number of consumers and suppliers,
respectively, are only slightly smaller than the marginal effects for the financial
measures of Ubox use. In contrast, product variety increased only 1.0% per additional
case. Again, all three measures are much less responsive to a change in the cumulative
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than the contemporaneous number of cases.
We next consider the impact of confirmed COVID-19 cases on Ubox sales
separately for each type of food product and supplier. The estimates in panel A of
Table 5 indicate that purchases of grain rose the most during the COVID-19 period
(13.1% per additional confirmed case), followed by fruits and vegetables (9.6%) and
frozen food (5.6%). Point estimates for purchases of drinks, other food and non-food
8

products are all positive, but imprecisely estimated. In panel B we report estimates
from supplier-specific models. Individual farms experienced the largest increase in
demand from COVID-19, with sales increasing 8.9% per additional confirmed case.
Agribusinesses and farm cooperatives experienced a slightly smaller increase in
demand, with sales increasing by 5.4% and 4.4% per case, respectively.
Because there were two counties in Taiwan without any COVID-19 cases, we
have the opportunity to test whether the presence of infections in other parts of the
country influenced the online shopping behavior of those living in areas that were free
of COVID-19. To investigate the existence of such “spillover effects”, we regressed
Ubox sales from the two counties without COVID-19 cases on the total number of
weekly or cumulative confirmed cases aggregated over all other counties in Taiwan.
The results, reported in Table 6, indicate a small spillover effect of infections in other
parts of the country in the two counties without any COVID-19 cases. Specifically, an
additional weekly case of COVID-19 was associated with a 1.7% increase in Ubox
sales in the counties without cases. Likewise, sales increased by 0.7% with the
addition of one cumulative case.
5.2. The effect of information seeking and availability on Ubox sales
Panel A of Table 7 contains estimates of the effect Google web and news searches
and newspaper mentions of COVID-19/Coronavirus on Ubox sales in all counties of
Taiwan. In order to compare the effects of a 100 index unit change in Google searches
to a 100 word change in newspaper mentions, we report elasticities computed using
the mean values during the COVID-19 period. 9 We find that Ubox sales are more
strongly associated with the frequency that COVID-19 was mentioned in newspapers
than Google searches for COVID-19. In particular, a 1% increase in Google web
searches is associated with a 0.8% increase in Ubox sales, and the elasticity for
Google news searches is slightly smaller in magnitude. In contrast, a 1% increase in
newspaper mentions of COVID-19 is associated with a much larger 3.8% increase in
Ubox sales. In panel B of Table 7 we present estimates for Google searches and
newspaper mentions from models where the dependent variable is Ubox sales in the
two counties in Taiwan without any COVID-19 infections. The elasticity estimates are
all much smaller than for full sample in panel A, but they are still statistically
significant, suggesting there is some spillover effect of information about COVID-19
in counties with confirmed cases.

9

In other tables, when we express marginal effects in percentage terms we use the mean of the nonCOVID-19 period in order to accurately characterize the percentage increase in the marginal effect due
to COVID-19. In this case, however, it is the elasticity during the COVID-19 period that is of interest,
not the elasticity during the average period (when COVID-19 is present only 25% of the time).

9

5.3. Specification tests and robustness checks
We subjected our models to several tests in order to validate our specification and
gage the robustness of our results. First, we tested whether our key regressors, weekly
and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases, exhibit a linear or nonlinear relationship
with Ubox platform sales by estimating Robinson’s semiparametric partial linear
model (Robinson 1988; Verardi and Debarsy 2012). Under this specification, weekly
or cumulative cases enter the model as a Gaussian kernel-weighted polynomial.
Hardle and Mammen (1993) developed a test of whether the nonparametric
component of the model can be approximated by a parametric polynomial.
Implementing the test for a polynomial of order one is a test of the typical linear
parametric specification. Appendix Table A2 contain estimates from the
semiparametric partial linear model and the test results for linearity of the weekly and
cumulative case variables. For both regressors, we fail to reject the null hypothesis
that the model is linear in the key regressor. Plots of the nonparametric relationship
between weekly and cumulative COVID-19 cases and Ubox sales in Figure A1
provide further evidence of a linear relationship between the regressors and outcome
variable.
We next investigated whether the treatment and control periods in our fixed effect
model are properly defined. The beginning of our treatment period is the day of the
first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Taiwan. However, prior to this date there were
numerous confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and it is possible that consumers
in Taiwan could have changed their food shopping habits in response to media reports
about the outbreak in China. To test for evidence of such an “anticipation effect” we
estimated our model of Ubox sales on Google web and news searches and COVID-19
newspaper mentions using the three weeks prior to the first confirmed case of
COVID-19 in Taiwan. 10 As shown in Table A3, the coefficient estimates for all three
information variables are statistically insignificant, suggesting consumers in Taiwan
did not increase their use of Ubox prior to the advent of coronavirus cases in Taiwan.
In our main models we pool the January 21 – April 6 period for 2017, 2018 and
2019 to create the non-COVID-19 (control) period in our model. In order to test
whether years earlier in time provide the same control properties as years closer in
time to the treatment period, we re-estimated the models for Ubox sales separately
using each of the three control years. The estimates in Table A4 are similar across all
three years, suggesting that pooling the three yearly samples in the control period is
appropriate.
10

An anticipation effect occurs if consumers in Taiwan change their food shopping behavior prior to
confirmation of any COVID-19 cases in Taiwan under the assumption that there are undetected cases in
the community.

10

Throughout the analysis we use confirmed rather than confirmed and suspected
(i.e. total) cases of COVID-19 to measure the impact of the pandemic on the outcome
variables. Our rationale is that only conformed cases are included in weekly CDC
press conferences on infections rates. In addition, we are unsure of the accuracy of unconfirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. In Table A5 we report estimates for models of Ubox
financial outcomes that use total (confirmed and suspected) cases. We divided the two
COVID-19 case count variables by 100 to put them on roughly the same scale as the
confirmed case counts. 11 The magnitude of an additional 100 weekly cases is
approximately three times larger, and an additional 100 cumulative cases one and half
times larger than estimates from the models that use confirmed cases. By implication,
total cases may be more highly correlated with consumer information about the threat
of the coronavirus pandemic than confirmed cases. However, we prefer using
confirmed cases for our main results because this measure is not subject to the
differential beliefs of healthcare providers. In addition, the non-monotonic trend in
weekly total cases in Table 1 suggests that there could be a significant amount of
measurement error in suspected cases.
Both Ubox sales and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are trending upward over
time. We include week and year fixed effects in our models to account for the
deterministic trend in Ubox sales, but we wanted to investigate whether our estimates
might still reflect a spurious correlated in two positively trending variables. We
therefore conducted a falsification test by regressing the financial measures of Ubox
performance in the control period on weekly and cumulative cases. The estimates,
reported in Table A6, are statistically insignificant in all cases, which is consistent
with the failure of our models to reflect a spurious correlation.
A final concern is that confirmed COVID-19 cases counts could be correlated
with time-varying unobservable factors that determine consumer preferences for
online food shopping. For example, those with a higher tolerance for risk may be
more likely to contract COVID-19 and less likely to order food from Ubox. In order
to assess the potential for this type of endogeneity to bias our estimates we
implemented the sensitivity analysis proposed by Oster (2019), which is based on
earlier work by Altonji et al. (2005). Under the assumption that selection on the
observed covariates is proportional to selection on unobservable factors, Oster (2019)
constructs an estimator for the degree of selection on unobservables relative to
observables (δ) needed for the true effect of the treatment variable to be a statistical
null. We report estimates of δ for both weekly and cumulative confirmed cases in the
models of Ubox platform profits, payments to producers and profits in Table A7 12.

12

The COVID-19 period mean of total cases is 300 and the mean on just confirmed cases is 3.17.
To implement the sensitivity analysis, we include all of the explanatory variables and the fixed

11

The values range from 2.4 – 2.8, suggesting that a very high level of selection on
unbservables is required for our non-zero estimates to represent a spurious correlation.
Both Oster (2019) and Altonji et al. (2005) suggest one as a reasonable upper bound
for δ.
6. Discussion and Conclusions
By analyzing several financial performance measures of Ubox, an online food
shopping platform, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased
online food shopping in Taiwan. Given that Ubox sales increased by 5.7% per
additional case, there was an 18% increase in sales during the average week after
COVID-19 arrived in Taiwan. Likewise, Ubox customers grew 16% in a typical week
during the COVID-19 period. Such a rapid increase in demand raises the question of
whether food supply chain restrictions may have limited Ubox’s ability to meet the
requests of all potential customers. If in fact Ubox was operating at capacity during
the COVID-19 period then our models will underestimate the latent demand for
online food shopping services during the pandemic.
Both the increase in demand for online Ubox products and the consequent effects
on the supply chain were not uniform across food product categories. Grain products
experienced the largest surge in demand, which could be due to the storable nature of
raw grain, and an increase in home production of grain-based foods like breads and
bakery items. In a typical week, sales from grain increased approximately 42% during
the COVID-19 period. Fresh fruit and vegetables and frozen food were also in high
demand. The latter is storable, much like grain, but this is not the case for fresh fruit
and vegetables. Nonetheless, consumers in Taiwan typically purchase fresh fruit and
vegetables in outdoor markets, which could be risky to patronize during the pandemic.
COVID-19 did not benefit all producers equally. Products sold by individual farms
experienced stronger demand than those sold by larger agribusinesses and farm
cooperatives. The benefit to individual farms may be due in part to their
proportionally larger share of fresh fruits and vegetables sold through the Ubox
platform. 13
We find that the variety of food products purchased on Ubox increased during
the COVID-19 period. This could be due to the use of the platform by new customers
with different preferences than existing customers. Alternatively, it could reflect the
substitution of food prepared at home for FAFH as customers sought to limit their
exposure to others in the community. In order to replace meals typically purchased at

effects. Therefore, we tested the remaining bias due to the unobserved time variant factors.
13
Individual farms supplied 42% of fresh fruit and vegetables to Ubox, while farm cooperatives and
agribusinesses supplied 36% and 22% of the product, respectively.

12

restaurants with home cooked meals households may have needed to purchase a wider
variety of food products than previously.
A key question for the food industry is to what extent the increased use of online
shopping platforms will persist after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and the
pandemic finally abates (Hobbs 2020). Unlike the U.S. or most countries in Europe,
Taiwan did not shutdown businesses or impose a stay-at-home order. The country did
adopt strict restrictions on international travel from China and other countries with
high rates of infections, and it did mandate the use of facemasks in public.
Nonetheless, the mobility of Taiwanese citizens within the country was relatively
unaffected by COVID-19. As a result, we believe that the increase in online food
shopping that was experienced in Taiwan may be similar to what will be experienced
in the U.S. and Europe after stay-at-home orders and business restrictions are reduced.
The number of COVID-19 infections will continue to grow after restrictions are
removed in the U.S. and Europe, but consumers will regain their mobility, which
mirrors the environment we used to generate our estimates in Taiwan.
A recent study of Sweden and Denmark found that most of the economic
contraction brought on by the coronavirus pandemic was due to changes in consumer
behavior, and not mandated social distancing and restrictions on economic activities
(Andersen et al. 2020). By implication, if consumer preferences are more important in
driving economic behavior than restrictions, the greater use of online food shopping
identified in this study may be largely translatable to other countries, even if they do
have restrictions. Our estimates of the effect of Google searchers and newspaper
mentions of COVID-19 are consistent with the notion that consumer preferences drive
consumption shifts observed during the coronavirus pandemic. Ranging between 0.7
and 0.8, the elasticity of Ubox sales to web searches is much larger than the elasticity
with respect to confirmed weekly COVID-19 cases of 0.2. The elasticity of sales to
suspected and confirmed cases combined is 0.4, which is more similar to web
searches, but clearly the switch to online food shopping is more sensitive to consumer
perceptions of COVID-19 risks than actual case counts. The source of these
perceptions is typically information in the news media since most consumers do not
have personal knowledge of an infected person or their experiences. The high level of
responsiveness of Ubox sales to newspaper mentions highlights the significant impact
the media can have on consumer purchasing decisions. It also helps to explain why
most individuals overestimate the risk of a COVID-19 infection (Akesson et al. 2020).
Estimating the extent of a permanent shift to online food shopping after the
development of a COVID-19 vaccine is more difficult. 14 One study of the Korean
14

A study of antibody levels in Sweden, a country without any mobility or business restrictions, found
that a modest percentage of the Swedish population had developed COVID-19 antibody levels by

13

experience found that employment losses caused by local outbreaks in regions
without stay-at-home and business restrictions were concentrated in the
accommodation/food service industry, among several others (Aum, Lee and Shin
2020). By implication, demand for FAFH in Taiwan will presumably recover after the
threat of COVID-19 diminishes. If some of the increased demand for Ubox products
was due to a substitution from FAFH, that demand could dissipate over the long run.
Ultimately, whether consumers continue to use online food shopping platforms, such
as Ubox, depends on whether they find the experience superior to shopping at retail
establishments under normal circumstances. We are not aware of any scientific studies
that estimate the persistence of online food shopping following initial exposure, but
given the steady increase in the use of online platforms in several countries, we expect
that many consumers who were motivated to use online platforms for the first time
due to COVID-19, will continue to use them in the future, even if only occasionally.
Our study has some limitations that should be recognized. We analyze
transactions from one large online food shopping platform in Taiwan, and the shift in
food consumption patterns we identify might not be generalizable to online platforms
in other countries with different consumer characteristics. In addition, our panel data
fixed effect approach may not fully account for consumer selection into the use of the
online platform. In particular, it is possible that there was selection into online food
shopping by consumers in counties with higher exposure to COVID-19 based on
unobservable time-varying factors. Finally, increasing trends in both COVD-19 and
online food shopping could lead to spurious correlations. Although we have presented
robustness checks that our consistent with our model’s ability to account for both
selection and time trends, not all forms of bias can be captured using available tests.
Despite these limitations, we believe this study makes an important contribution
to the literature as the first to identify the impact of COVID-19 on consumers’ use of
online food shopping. This is an important topic because the ability to have food
delivered at home is an important strategy that individuals can use to reduce their
likelihood of exposure to COVID-19. Due to the high risk faced by the elderly or
those with chronic medical conditions, the need to isolate oneself from others in the
community can be pressing and doing so is only possible if food can be obtained from
home. In addition, the use of online food shopping platforms can generate a positive
public health externality because individuals that stay at home do not infect others in
the community if they are carriers of the virus.
Our results also have relevance for agricultural policy. The Ubox platform was
created by the Taiwanese Council of Agriculture in part to provide smaller, individual
April, 2020 (Ahlander and Pollard 2020). It is, therefore, likely that a vaccine will be developed before
any region develops herd immunity to the virus (Branswell 2020).

14

farms with a low-cost outlet to reach consumers. Similar mechanisms have been
adopted in other countries to help promote small farms, and studies have found that
famers that sell food directly to consumers are more likely to survive than those that
only sell through wholesalers (Gerrard 2017; Key, 2017). Our results indicate that
individual farms benefited most from the increase in demand due to COVID-19.
Importantly, small farmers lack many of means of financial insurance afforded to
employees of larger agribusinesses, putting them at greater risk of income loss during
the pandemic. Our findings suggest that online direct-to-consumer platforms, such as
Ubox, can be used to protect small farmers during the pandemic or at other times
when their income streams are disrupted by sudden shifts in demand.
