ABSTRACT
We summarize some of the early effects and discuss possible future effects of the COVID-19
pandemic and recession on the employment outcomes of older workers in the United States. We
start by discussing what we know about how older workers faired in prior recessions in the
United States and how COVID-19 and this recession may differ. We then estimate some early
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and recession on employment and unemployment rates by age
group and sex using Current Population Survey data. We calculate employment and
unemployment rates multiple ways to account for the complicated employment situation and
possible errors in survey enumeration. We find that while previous recessions, in some ways, did
not affect employment outcomes for older workers as much, this recession disproportionately
affected older workers of ages 65 and older. For example, we find that unemployment rates in
April 2020 increased to 15.43% for those ages 65 and older, compared to 12.99% for those ages
25-44. We also find that COVID-19 and the recession disproportionately affected women, where
women have reached higher unemployment rates than men, which was consistent for all age
groups and unemployment rate measures we used.

Introduction
The arrival of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), led to pandemic that significantly upended economies and strained health care and social
welfare systems worldwide. The United States confirmed its first case on January 21, 2020. As of
June 18, there were 24,498 new cases, and a total of 2.24 million confirmed cases, 699,063
recoveries, and 120,302 deaths in the United States (1Point3Acres, 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic and the policies to curb its spread brought parts of the U.S.
economy to a virtual halt in March 2020. Payroll jobs declined by 0.7 million in March 2020 and
20.5 million in April 2020, pushing the seasonally adjusted official unemployment rate (U-3) to a
peak of 14.7% in April 2020 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020a, 2020b). This rate surpasses
the peak rates during the Great Recession (10.6%, January 2010) and the early 1980s recession
(11.4%, January 1983) (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020c). However, even these high
unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic are severely underestimated, as we discussed
later, with a more realistic unemployment rate being at least 21.6% in March 2020 (Montenovo et
al., 2020).
There is limited analysis of how the COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting recession, impact
older workers. In this report, we summarize the early effects and discuss possible future effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic and recession on older workers in the United States. We start by
discussing what we know about how older workers faired in prior recessions in the United States
and how COVID-19 and this recession may differ. We then estimate some early effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and recession on employment and unemployment rates by age group and
sex. We conclude with a brief discussion of important topics for future research as the pandemic
develops and hopefully resolves, and as new data sources become available.

How Did Older Workers Fare in Previous Recessions?
Knowing how older workers fared in prior recessions may help forecast how they will be
affected in this recession. Prior research shows that older workers are differentially affected by
recessions. One way they are less impacted is that in prior recessions, the probability of
displacement generally declined with age since older workers often benefitted from employment
seniority (Johnson & Butrica, 2012). Older people also faced smaller increases in their
unemployment rate, (Johnson & Butrica, 2012 and Figure 3) although that is partly because older
people are more likely to leave the labor force.
In other ways, recessions hit older workers harder. Older workers took longer to find work
during and after the Great Recession (Neumark & Button, 2014), and unemployed workers in their
fifties also faced steeper wage losses (Johnson & Butrica, 2012). Age discrimination in hiring also
increases during recessions, contributing to the longer unemployment durations for older workers.
Age discrimination is a significant barrier for older workers who often take temporary jobs – called
bridge jobs – to delay retirement (Neumark, Burn & Button, 2019).
Regardless of whether older workers face a more significant negative economic shock, a
given shock could affect them more. Coile et al. (2014) find that workers approaching retirement
during a recession are disproportionately likely to suffer long-lasting negative consequences,
including years of reduced replacement earnings, loss of healthcare coverage, lower utilization of
healthcare, and reduced longevity.
Decreases in retirement accounts also affect older people more. Munnell & Rutledge
(2013) and Munnell, Webb & Golub-Sass (2012) summarize the decreases in retirement security
that older people faced during and after the Great Recession, finding, for example that the National
Retirement Risk Index (NRRI) rose from 44 in 2007 to 52 in 2010. The NRRI estimates the share

5

of working households who are “at risk” for being unable to maintain their preretirement standard
of living in retirement (Munnell & Rutledge, 2013).
Younger people were, of course, less affected as they did not need to access retirement
savings and had longer to recover from losses. Older workers had only three options: save more,
work longer, or live on less in retirement (Munnell & Rutledge, 2013). Saving more was difficult
given the short time frame and low interest rates. Working longer is a great option but is frustrated
by a weak economy and age discrimination that may increase during a recession. Partly for this
reason, early retirement increases during and after recessions (Rutledge & Coe, 2012). Thus,
many older workers suffer through reduced retirement security and claim Social Security earlier
than they would like to. Early retirement essentially reduces monthly monthly Social Security
benefits by stretching them over a longer time frame. Thus, recessions increase the poverty among

retirees, a group who face higher poverty races, especially women (Burn, Button, Figinski &
McLaughlin, forthcoming).
How Might the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Recession be Different?
The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge that disproportionately affects
older people for numerous reasons. The most evident and horrifying impact is higher mortality and
morbidity rates for older people. For those that get COVID-19, mortality rates are 8.6% for those
in their 70s, 4% for 60s, 1.25% for 50s, and 0.3% for those in their 40s (Begley, 2020). As of June
17, 2020, 92.6% of COVID-19 deaths in the United States were those ages 55 and older (National
Center for Health Statistics, 2020), despite this group being only 29.1% of the population (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2020). Increased mortality among older people can also make older women more
likely to become widowed. This increases poverty among older women, since widowed women
face high poverty rates (Burn et al., forthcoming).

6

For those that survive COVID-19, there are lingering negative impacts. Early evidence
suggests that there are long-term impacts on health, such as blood clotting, strokes, embolisms,
heart or lung damage, and neurological symptoms (Du, 2020). These conditions will reduce labor
supply and will further increase applications to Social Security Disability Insurance, especially for
older people, further straining the Social Security Trust Funds.
The effects on retirement savings thus far seem large. Equity holdings took a large hit. For
example, Fidelity Advisors estimates that 401(k) plans balances fell about 19% in the first quarter
of 2020 and that individual retirement plan balances fell by 14%. (Brandus, 2020). Low interest
rates are reducing returns on short-term deposits and decreases in housing prices are reducing the
housing equity that could be cashed in for retirement.
This decline in retirement security will motivate many older people to work longer to
increase savings and delay Social Security claiming to increase monthly benefit amounts. A
common way that older people work longer is through taking bridge jobs (Johnson, Kawachi, &
Lewis, 2009). Examples include managerial positions, transportation drivers, sales, and
construction for men, and managerial, administrative/clerical, sales, and personal service for
women (Cahill, Giandrea & Quinn, 2011; Neumark, Burn & Button, 2019).
However, workers in bridge jobs face an increased exposure risk to SARS-CoV-2. Using
data from Montenovo et al. (2010), it appears that bridge jobs, especially for women, have higher
rates of face-to-face contact and are less likely to allow for remote work, making these jobs riskier.
Early evidence suggests that retirement increased significantly in the first months of the pandemic
(Coibion, Gorodnichenko & Weber, 2020), suggesting that older workers are retiring early instead
of taking the risk.

7

Even if older people brave the elevated risks to apply for jobs, they may face even more
age discrimination in addition to the high levels of age discrimination that already occur, especially
during recessions (Neumark & Button, 2014). Employers may, for example, assume that older
people are riskier to hire because their age group is statistically more susceptible to COVID-19.
These barriers to working longer will increase early retirement, Social Security claiming, and
increase poverty among retirees. For all these reasons, we anticipate that COVID-19 and the
resulting recession will negatively impact older people more than prior recessions, which we now
explore with some available data.
Data
We use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), via IPUMS-CPS (Flood, King,
Rodgers, Ruggles, & Warren, 2020), to provide an early look (up to April 2020) at impacts on the
employment outcomes of older workers. However, classifying the employment status of
individuals has been error prone during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we calculate two
versions of the employment rate and three versions of the unemployment rate.
The employment rate, as typically calculated, is the number of employed individuals,
including those deemed “has job, not at work last week,” divided by the population. However, the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that survey enumerators often misclassified individuals as
“has job, not at work last week” instead of “unemployed” (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020d).
For this reason, we calculate a modified employment rate that excludes the “not at work” group,
counting only those at work.
For the unemployment rate, we start by calculating the official unemployment rate (U-3)
and the broader “U-6” unemployment rate, which counts marginally attached workers and those
underemployed “for economic reasons” as unemployed. i However, even this broad U-6 rate could

8

underestimate unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We construct a “U-6+” rate, which
broadens the U-6 rate by adding those who are underemployed for one of three reasons that could
relate to COVID-19: own illness, injury, or medical problem; slack work, or business conditions;
or on layoff (temporary or indefinite) (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020d).
Results: Employment and Labor Force Participation Rates
[Table 1 about here]
[Figure 1 about here]
Figure 1 presents employment rates by age group (ages 25-44, 55-64, 65+) and sex from
January 1976 to April 2020. Table 1 summarizes the changes in all the employment and
unemployment variables from the average in 2019 to April 2020. Figure 1 shows a substantial
decrease in employment at the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a clear outlier compared
to the last five recessions (shaded in grey). Figure 1 and Table 1, panel A, show that this decrease
was the most substantial in percentage point terms for ages 25-44: an 11.31 (10.56) percentage
point decrease for men (women) in April 2020 compared to the average in 2019. The percentage
point decrease is smaller for ages 55-64: 7.15 (7.54) for men (women), and ages 65+: 4.16 (3.07)
for men (women).
While the smaller percentage point decrease in employment for older workers could be
interpreted as COVID-19 having a more significant adverse effect on younger workers, percentage
point changes in employment rates would be expected to be proportion to the rates themselves.
Another way to estimate the change in employment rates is to calculate a percent change.
Workers 65+, namely women 65+, had the largest percent change. For women ages 65+
their average employment rate was 16.36% in 2019, and this decreased by 3.07 percentage points
to 13.29% in April 2020. This is an 18.75% decrease in the employment rate, the largest decrease

9

for all age and sex groups (for men 65+ it was a 16.92% decrease). One way to conceptualize this
is that out of 100 women (men) of ages 65 and older who were employed, about 19 (17) became
non-employed. The percent decrease in the employment rate was smaller for the younger age
groups: a 12.98% (14.27%) decrease for men (women) of ages 25-44, and 10.21% (12.92%)
decrease for men (women) of ages 55-64.
The way to interpret this discrepancy between larger percentage point decreases for
younger workers and men, but larger percent decreases for older workers and women, is that the
economic shock of COVID-19 hit employed individuals of ages 65+ and women more harshly,
but while a smaller economic shock hit younger workers and men, there were more of them that
were impacted due to higher existing employment rates.
Our alternative measure of employment (Table 1, panel B) that helps correct for possible
misclassification errors shows larger percentage point and percent decreases in the employment
rate, but otherwise, the patterns mirror those for the standard measure of employment.
[Figure 2 about here]
Figure 2 and Table 1, panel C, present labor force participation rates. There is no apparent
decrease in the participation rate in previous recessions for any group, but there is an apparent
decrease since January 2020 for those ages 25-44 and 65+ groups. Like with the employment rate,
those ages 65+ experienced the largest percent decrease (5.59%). However, the participation rate
decreases for women are generally somewhat smaller. Unfortunately, the Current Population
Survey data does not allow us to determine effects on the timing of retirement; however, early
evidence from Coibion, Gorodnichenko & Weber (2020)'s analysis of the Nielsen Homescan panel
suggests that retirement has increased significantly.
Results: Unemployment Rates

10

[Figure 3 about here]
Figure 3 and Table 1, panel D, present the official (U-3) unemployment rates. The increase
in the unemployment rate in April 2020 was dramatic and rapid, with unemployment rates
increasing by a staggering 13.81 (11.36) percentage points for women (men) ages 65+, compared
to the average rates in 2019, resulting in an unemployment rate of 16.85% (14.26%) for women
(men) ages 65+. Unemployment rates also increased significantly, but by less, for the younger age
groups. For women (men) ages 25-44, the unemployment rate increased 10.39 (9.10) percentage
points in April 2020, compared to in 2019. For women (men) ages 55-64, the unemployment rate
increased 11.24 (8.42) percentage points. All these changes represent massive percent changes in
unemployment rates, with unemployment rates being 282 to 454% larger than they were in 2019.
Older people and women faced both higher percentage point and percent increases in
unemployment rates.
This rapid and severe increase in the unemployment rate is much more dramatic than the
increases in previous recessions. In Figure 3, the increase in the unemployment rate in the early
onset of COVID-19 is two to three times larger than in the peak of the Great Recession of 20072009. We also see that the COVID-19 recession impacted workers 65+ more than younger
workers, while this is the opposite in previous recessions. This is clear early evidence that the
COVID-19 pandemic and recession is hitting older workers harder.
[Figure 4 about here]
However, this picture is even worse for all workers, older workers especially, when we
broaden how we calculate the unemployment rate to better capture the complicated employment
picture during the pandemic. Figure 4 presents the broader U-6 unemployment rates by age group
and sex, and Table 1, panel E, summarizes the percentage point and percent decreases in the U-6

11

rate. U-6 rates are much higher than U-3 rates, with the U-6 rate in 2019 being between 2.5 and
4.2 times higher than the U-3 rate. The gap between the U-6 and U-3 rates is largest for workers
65+, especially women. Women (men) ages 65+ had a U-3 rate of 3.04% (2.90%) in 2019 but a
U-6 rate of 12.50% (10.60%). Women also face a larger gap between U-3 and U-6 rates. This
suggests that older people and women are more likely to be marginally attached to the labor force
and are also more likely to be underemployed.
Using the U-6 rate shows an even higher unemployment rate in April 2020: between 20.24
and 29.18% in April 2020. The percentage point increase in the U-6 rate is again the largest for
ages 65+, especially women, but the difference in the percentage point increase by age group and
sex is less pronounced using the U-6 rate.
However, even this broad U-6 rate could potentially underestimate unemployment due to
the classification issues summarized above. We, therefore, constructed a "U-6+" rate, which adds
those who are underemployed for COVID-19-specific reasons. Table 1, panel F, presents the
percentage point and percent increases in our U-6+ rate. As expected, the U-6+ rate is slightly
higher than the U-6 rate in 2019: between 0.91 and 1.39 percentage points higher. This broadest
unemployment rate measure leads to unemployment rates of between 21.01 to 29.68% in April
2020. While the U-6 rate showed that the percentage point increase was slightly larger for those
ages 65+, with our U-6+ rate, we do not find that those ages 65+ had a larger increase. However,
we again find that the increase was more substantial for women, which is consistent for all
measures of the unemployment rate.
Conclusion
Older workers are often hit hard by recessions, and often harder than younger workers.
Recessions cause reductions in employment and earnings, increased early Social Security

12

claiming, reduced retirement savings, and increased poverty at old ages. The COVID-19 pandemic
and resulting recession hit older people, especially older women, even harder than past recessions.
This is due both to the COVID-19 recession having a larger magnitude, but also because the
pandemic creates additional risks for older workers that cut their (work) lives short.
In this report, we can only discuss early impacts, but the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing.
We plan to update our analysis as new data becomes available. We also plan to extend our analysis
to make it more detailed, such as by studying intersectionality with race and ethnicity, as COVID19 is widening existing disparities faced by people of color.
There is significant room for future research, which can explore data that was not available
to us. Data from the Health and Retirement Study is the most useful for studying older workers,
although it is released with a long lag. For example, future work could use this data to analyze
bridge jobs (see, e.g., Cahill, Giandrea & Quinn, 2011) or effects on retirement and labor supply
(see, e.g., Rutledge & Coe, 2012).

Notes: Author’s calculations using data from the Current Population Survey (monthly) from 1976 to April 2020, via IPUMS-CPS (Flood et al., 2020). We use the average rate in
2019 rather than the rate in April 2019 to reduce sampling variation. All estimates are not seasonally adjusted. All estimates are weighted using population weights.

Marginally attached individuals are those who searched for work sometime within the last 12 months, but not
within the last four weeks (searching in the last four weeks is a requirement to be deemed unemployed). Included
within marginally attached workers are discouraged workers, who stopped searching because they were discouraged
about job prospects. Those deemed underemployed “for economic reasons” are individuals who work part time,
report that they would like to work full time, but cannot find a full-time job.
